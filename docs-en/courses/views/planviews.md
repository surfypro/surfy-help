# Plan Views

Plan views are pre-programmings of display and features to choose according to the user's field of action. These are "shortcuts" to the requested features.

<Youtube code="C-0l8So1Uto"/>

## Choose a Plan View

You can choose a particular view of plans depending on the task to accomplish or information to obtain, from a floor plan, by clicking on the vertical "change plan view" icon.
Changing view resets the plan configuration by displaying information corresponding to the requested view.

The default view is recognizable by the small flag at the end of the view line. The default view is programmable for each user by modifying each person's role (Make the request to the platform administrator)

The selected view is valid for the user, across the entire platform. It will remain the same until it is changed and until "logout".
To log out of the platform, click at the bottom of the left menu on the user's first name or initials, then on "log out".

Upon reconnection, the default view -with the small flag- will be effective.

## "Space Typologies" View

This is Surfy's "standard" pre-programming, displayed by default.
It allows you to color spaces by typology, that is by their usage destination: office, sanitary facilities, staircase,...
Typologies must be filled in at minimum in Surfy to obtain first colored plans.
This view displays space names and workstations.

See the chapter [Create a Space Typology](/docs/tutorials/surfaces/room/roomtype.md#create-a-space-typology)

You can obtain cumulative data by Typology by clicking on the vertical "Color spaces on the plan according to space typologies" icon then on the butterfly "Open all details and indicators".

This view is adapted to the [Workplace Environment Management](https://www.surfy.pro/ug/environnement-de-travail) which maintains the digitized building's life up to date in Surfy, particularly by [arranging spaces](/docs/courses/digitalize/digicourse.md).

## "Recharging" View

The "Recharging" view colors spaces and workstations by cost center and displays the surface and cost center name of each space.

You can obtain cumulative data by cost center by clicking on the vertical "Color spaces and workstations according to cost centers" icon then on the "Spaces" tab then on the butterfly "Open all details and indicators".
The "Workstations" tab allows counting workstations per cost center.

This view particularly corresponds to [Finance functions](https://www.surfy.pro/ug/fonction-finances) or [Real Estate Directors](https://www.surfy.pro/ug/direction-immobiliere) to manage [space recharging by cost center](/docs/tutorials/cost-distribution-by-cost-center/create.md).

## "Departments" View

The "Departments" view colors spaces by Department, and displays the surface and name of the linking Department for each space.
This view allows organizing or visualizing the good distribution of spaces according to the linking organization.

You can obtain cumulative data by Department or by Service by clicking on the vertical "Color spaces on the plan according to Organizations" icon then on the butterfly "Open all details and indicators".

This view is adapted to [Department assistants](https://www.surfy.pro/ff/affecter-les-collaborateurs) wanting to master their Service or Department perimeter.

## "Occupations" View

The "Occupations" view colors free workstations (in green), Flex workstations (in pink), shared workstations (in orange) and passing workstations (in blue) to allow rapid visualization of assignment capacities on the floor.
The name of each space and workstation is displayed.
No analysis layer is displayed, spaces remain without color.

You can select the [display of this information](/docs/courses/views/2Dviews.md#display-workstation-status-on-the-plan) by clicking on the vertical "Color workstations according to their status" icon.

This view is intended to quickly access occupation information and allows you to quickly return to the previous view.
The number of workstations of each qualification is permanently indicated in the building, floor or space record considered.

## "Flex" View

The "Flex" view colors workstations qualified as Flex (in pink) and allows rapid localization of these workstations.
No analysis layer is displayed, spaces remain without color.

You can access the [display of this information](/docs/courses/views/2Dviews.md#display-workstation-status-on-the-plan) by clicking on the vertical "Color workstations according to their status" icon.
"Bookable" workstations can be colored (in sky blue) to locate them on the plan.

This view is intended to quickly access information and allows you to quickly return to the previous view.
The number of workstations of each qualification is permanently indicated in the building, floor or space record considered.

## "Security Compliance" View

The "Security Compliance" view displays the name and quality of Security team members (File Guide, File Closer, First Aider, Firefighter, ...) on their workstation and colors their assignment workstation in a defined color.
No analysis layer is displayed, spaces remain without color.

This view is intended to quickly access information and allows you to quickly return to the previous view.
It is intended for [Security managers](https://www.surfy.pro/ug/sante-et-securite) wanting to [manage Security team members](/docs/tutorials/person/personSecurityProfile/list.md#visualize-security-profiles-on-plans) with complete peace of mind.

## "Neighborhoods" View

The "Neighborhoods" view colors spaces by assignment layers, groups spaces into neighborhoods following these layers and allows direct assignment of people to these neighborhoods.

This is the ideal view for the [assignment manager](https://www.surfy.pro/ff/affecter-les-collaborateurs), allowing them to [manage neighborhood assignment](/docs/tutorials/affectations/dimensiontoperson/create.md) but also [fixed assignments to workstations](/docs/tutorials/affectations/workplaceaffectation/create.md).
You can indeed mix in the same space workstations declared as Flex (bookable or not) and workstations with fixed assignment.

## "Partitions" View

In the "Partitions" view, no information or layer is displayed on the plan to visualize only the plan background.
This view allows [space planners](https://www.surfy.pro/ff/amenager-et-optimiser-les-espaces) to verify compliance and [modify the plan background](/docs/tutorials/surfaces/background/edit.md) if necessary.
