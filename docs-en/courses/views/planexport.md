# Save Plans as Images

You can export different types of plans as PNG files from Surfy:
-   2D floor plans
-   2D building floor plans, partial or complete
-   3D floor plans
-   3D building plans, partial or complete

All plans are exported in PNG format.

## Export 2D Plans as Images

### Export a Floor's 2D Plan

To export a floor's plan as an Image,

-   go to the concerned floor
-   display on the plan the layer and information necessary for Image output: furniture, text display, font sizes, icon sizes, ...

For more information on plan display configuration, see the chapter [Display 2D Plans](/docs/courses/views/2Dviews.md).

-   once the plan is configured, click on the "cloud" icon above the plan to "save as Image" the floor's plan.

-   choose the download option by clicking on:

    -   Entire plan with legend: to obtain the entire floor plan as it is in Surfy, with layer legends and cumulative information by layer
    -   Entire plan without legend: to obtain the entire floor plan as it is in Surfy, without legends
    -   Screenshot without legend: to obtain the part of the plan displayed on the screen, without legends

The PNG file is available in downloads.

### Configure the 2D Plan Legend to Export

When outputting a floor's plan as an image with legend, the "default legend" is composed of:

-   the company logo
-   the building name and address (if filled in)
-   the floor name
-   floor information, identical to the floor record information to the left of the plan
-   the displayed layer legend, with cumulative information by layer.

You can customize the legend displayed on the image output by creating legends adapted to the information to display.

For this, from the left menu,

-   click on "Administration" then "Legend" to "Create a legend"
-   give a name to the legend to create
-   in "Configuration", "Property selection", check the properties and information to display for "buildings" and "floors"
-   in "Space typologies", check the information to display (number of spaces, total capacity) for each space typology present on the platform
-   in "space typology groups", check the information to display (number of spaces, total capacity) for each space typology group present on the platform.
-   "validate the creation" of the legend

When outputting a floor's plan as an image with legend, "select the legend" to the right of the screen allows you to find the different saved legends to display the selected legend.

The legend preview is viewable by clicking on the "Preview legend" icon at the bottom of the "save as image" record to the right of the screen.

:::tip GOOD TO KNOW
A space typology group allows you to group several space typologies to facilitate their management and display.
You can create for example a "Meeting Spaces" space typology group grouping the "Meeting Room", "Bubble" and "Meeting Box" space typologies to display them or cumulate information from all typologies included in the group.

To configure a space typology group, see the chapter on [Space Typology Groups](/docs/tutorials/surfaces/room/roomtype/#space-typology-groups)

### Export 2D Plans of Several Floors

You can export plans of several floors simultaneously,
-   click on "Export images of entire building"
-   select floors to export
-   click on "download ZIP"

The compressed file is available in downloads.

:::tip Good to know
All floor plans take up the plan configuration from which the export is made: no need to load the right layer, the right legend or choose the right font size for each floor, once is enough!

## Export 3D Plans as Images

3D plans are available for the floor or for the building.
They are dynamic and interactive.

Each modification on the 2D plan is immediately reported on the 3D plan.

### Export a Building's 3D Plan

To obtain a building's 3D plan, from the home page,

-   click on the icon at the end of the concerned building's color line
-   select "building XXX's interactive 3D plan"
-   click on the vertical "gear" icon to "see plan options"
-   select floors to display in the building
-   choose the partition representation type (with partitions, without partitions or half-height partitions)
-   the "Cuby" representation replaces each space with a cube taking up the space's layer color

You can adjust the "space between each floor" by operating the slider to the left of the 3D plan.

The mouse wheel allows you to adjust the 3D plan size.
Left mouse click allows you to tilt and orient the plan in space
Right mouse click allows you to move the 3D plan in the screen window.

You can tilt the 3D plan with a constant angle, by clicking on "Center plan in Isometric view"

Once the 3D plan is correctly configured,

-   click on the vertical "gear" icon to "see plan options" (if not already the case)
-   click on "Download image"

The export gives the 3D building image as it is on the screen.
The building's 3D plan is available in downloads.

### Export a Floor's 3D Plan

To obtain a floor's 3D plan, from the floor plan,

-   click in the context menu (gray box below the search magnifying glass)
-   choose "Floor XXX's 3D plan"

The floor plan appears in 3D in zenith view

-   click on the vertical "gear" icon to "see plan options"
-   choose the partition representation type (with partitions, without partitions or half-height partitions)
-   the "Cuby" representation replaces each space with a cube taking up the space's layer color

The mouse wheel allows you to adjust the 3D plan size.
Left mouse click allows you to move the 3D plan in the screen window
Right mouse click allows you to tilt and orient the plan in space.

:::tip Good to know
Clicking on "Center plan in Zenith view" or "Center plan in Isometric view" allows you to display an image with calibrated dimensions in zenith or isometric view, and therefore interchangeable in third-party solution updates.
:::

Clicking on "Download image" generates the PNG file in downloads.
The floor's 3D image is as it is on the screen.
