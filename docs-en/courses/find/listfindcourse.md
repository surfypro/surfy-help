# Search in Lists

Lists constitute Surfy's database and include all elements created in Surfy: Buildings, floors, spaces, typologies, layers and layer types, cost centers, cost distribution types, objects and object types, workstations and workstation types, people, statuses, security profiles, relationships, organizations, etc...

These lists are independent of buildings and floors. They contain all created elements, but these are not necessarily used.
Lists are accessible from the left menu of the screen.

## List Data

To list the data to search for, from the left menu,
-   display the list corresponding to the element to search for (example: "Collaborators", "People" then "List people")

## Select Properties to List

Once elements are listed,
-   at the top right of the screen, click on the "Select properties you want to display in the table" icon
-   choose the properties to add as columns in the list (example: email, mobile, ...)

## Filter Information by Selected Criteria

Once the list columns are selected,
-   at the top right of the screen, click on the "Filter XXX" icon (example: Filter people)
-   choose the value to filter in the corresponding property box

:::warning ATTENTION
To avoid errors, it is important to "Clear all filters" after a list filter, to recover the complete list for a complete subsequent consultation
:::


## Export Filtered Data

-   at the top right of the screen, click on "Download XXX to Excel" (example: download people to Excel)
The list of selected elements with the listed properties is available as an Excel file in downloads.
