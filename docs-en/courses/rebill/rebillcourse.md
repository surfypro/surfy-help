# Recharge and Estimate

## Recharge Spaces by Cost Center

See the tutorials chapter [Recharge Spaces by Cost Center](/docs/tutorials/cost-distribution-by-cost-center/create.md)

    -   Define [cost centers](/docs/tutorials/costcenter/create.md)
    -   [Qualify spaces](/docs/tutorials/surfaces/room/edit#qualify-a-space-or-edit-space-information) and [workstations](/docs/tutorials/objects/workplace/edit.md#edit-workstation-information) by cost center
    -   Qualify spaces by [Cost Distribution Type](/docs/tutorials/costcenter/create.md#cost-distribution-type): space or workstations
    -   Obtain [distribution keys and cumulative surfaces](/docs/tutorials/cost-distribution-by-cost-center/create.md#distribution-keys-and-surfaces-qualified-by-cost-center) to invoice
    -   [Distribute common areas](/docs/tutorials/cost-distribution-by-cost-center/create.md#distribute-common-areas)
    -   Do not invoice spaces: Spaces and workstations without [cost distribution type](/docs/tutorials/costcenter/create.md#cost-distribution-type) do not appear anywhere and their surface is not counted anywhere.
      

## Estimate a Cleaning Service

    -   [Define cleaning frequencies](/docs/tutorials/dimensionType/create.md#create-and-associate-an-analysis-layer-to-a-layer-type)
    -   Define [cleaning cadences](/entities/admin/types/room-types/room-type#cadence) of space typologies or Define the <P code="roomType:cadence"/>
    -   [Qualify spaces by cleaning frequency](/docs/tutorials/surfaces/room/edit#qualify-a-space-or-edit-space-information)
    -   [Obtain the monthly hours needed for the cleaning service](/docs/tutorials/BuildingData/Buildingdashboard/Buildingreporting#building-cleaning-services-report)
