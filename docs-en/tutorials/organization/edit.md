# Edit an Organization

## Edit Organization Information

To modify organization information in Surfy, from the left menu,

-   click on "Organizations", "Organizations" then "View organization hierarchy".
-   Departments are at the head of the obtained blocks, Services are listed following.
-   clicking on the icon at the end of the line "see more options for organization XXX" then "edit organization XXX" allows you to modify the <P code="organization:name" /> or <P code="organization:color" /> of the concerned organization. Modifying this information does not modify attachments to entities.
-   in the case of a Service, you can modify its <P code="organization:organization" /> by clicking on the "pencil" icon of its "Department". This does not modify entity attachments to this Service.

:::warning Important
Removing the <P code="organization:organization" /> from a Service will change this Service to a Department.
Entities will still be attached to this organization but it will no longer be accessible in Service choices until a new "Department" is attached to it.

## Visualize Organizations on Plans

Once space attachments are modified, it is necessary to "reload plan data" by clicking on the icon at the top right of the screen, then refresh (F5).
From the floor or building plan, click on the vertical icon "Color spaces on the plan according to organizations" to visualize organizations in color on plans.

Three tabs are offered:
-   SERVICES: displays Services in color and cumulative information of Services
-   DEPARTMENTS: displays Departments in color and cumulative information of Departments
-   HIERARCHY: displays Services in color and cumulative information of Services by Department

By opening the "butterfly" at the end of each organization's line, you get cumulative information for the organization, for the visualized floor or building.
