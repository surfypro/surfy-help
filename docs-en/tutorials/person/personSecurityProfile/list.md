# Manage Security Profiles

<Youtube code="NxKeIipAJfs"/>

## Assign a Security Profile to a person

To assign a Security Profile to a person, it must already be created to be present in the choice list.

To create a Security Profile, see the chapter [Create a Security Profile](/docs/tutorials/person/personSecurityProfile/create.md)


To assign a security profile to a person,

-   access the person's record
-   edit the record by clicking in the context menu (gray box under the search magnifying glass) then "edit person XXX" 
-   click on the "pencil" icon in the "Security Profile" row
-   select the desired security profile for the person
-   save the changes

:::tip Good to know
If the Security Profile to assign to a person is not in the choice list, it means it hasn't been created yet.
Above this list, you can "create and associate" a new security profile: the creation will then directly assign the new Security Profile to the person.

## View Security Profiles on plans

### "Security Compliance" view

To view Security Profiles on a plan, you can select the "Security Compliance" view:

-   go to the concerned floor
-   click on the vertical "plan views" icon
-   select the "Security Compliance" view

Security team members' workstations are displayed in the color of the person's Security Profile.
No layer is selected, plans are "white" and other workstations as well.

:::warning
After a temporary view change, it's better to return to the "Space Typologies" view or the default view to avoid being in the wrong configuration for the next use.

### Display Security Profiles by the vertical "Person" icon

You can also permanently view Security Profiles on plans by clicking on the vertical "person" icon to "color workstations according to people". The active layer is not modified.
Security team members' workstations are displayed in the color of the person's Security Profile.

-   The "BY ASSIGNMENTS" tab displays the number of people (and induced workstations) assigned on the plan by Security Profile and the display validation of each.

-   The "BY SECURITY PROFILES" tab displays the number of people assigned on the plan by Security Profile. By clicking on the "butterfly" at the end of the Security Profile row, you get the names of security team members and their assignment position.

When a workstation is shared by two different security profiles, the assignment position is striped in both colors. You can have up to three different Security Profiles on the same workstation.
