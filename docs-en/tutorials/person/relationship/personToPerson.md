# Person to Person Relationship

A person to person relationship allows you to create a "natural relationship" from the "source" person to the "destination" person.
The "inverse relationship" applies from the "destination" person to the "source" person.

## Relationship Type

The "relationship type" defines the "natural relationship" between two people: for example, "is manager of".
You also define the "inverse relationship" between these people: in this case, "is managed by".

This relationship type is then used to define the relational link between people. In the example, you get the list of teams, their manager, but also the manager's manager, etc...

To create the relationship type, from the left menu,

-   click on "Collaborators", "Relations", "Person to Person Relationship Types", then "Create a person to person relationship type".
-   fill in the "natural relationship" (example: "is manager of") and the "inverse relationship" (example: "is managed by")
-   validate the creation.
-   the relationship type is created.
