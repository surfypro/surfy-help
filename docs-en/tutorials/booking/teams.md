# Book with Teams in Surfy

In Teams, you can add the Surfy application by clicking on "Application" and searching for "Surfy".<br />
Once selected, the application is added to Teams and directly allows the authorized collaborator to use Surfy's booking features via Teams.<br />
Using the collaborator's professional Office365 account allows them direct access to Surfy via automatic authentication.<br />
The collaborator must be assigned to a building, floor or neighborhood to be able to book in this building, floor or neighborhood.


For more information, please [contact us](https://www.surfy.pro/contact) to configure Surfy and allow you to use the Teams application for booking in Surfy.

The workstation's information is displayed under the reserved day.
Clicking on the booking line gives access to the workstation's position on the plan and displays the name and photo of the person on the reserved workstation.

Colleagues who have already booked in a neighborhood on this day are listed under the neighborhood box. To locate a colleague's booking location on the plan, click on their booking line.<br />
The neighborhood plan appears, workstations available for booking are colored in green.<br />
Already booked workstations are colored in orange on the plan, with the name and possible photo of the colleague who booked.

-   clicking on an already made booking shows the reserved workstation's position, colored in blue with name and possible photo.
-   clicking on the trash can deletes this booking.

The floor plan is displayed, with all bookings made on the requested date.<br />

-   "find a colleague or consult their planning" by entering the colleague's name in the designated field.<br />
The colleague's bookings for the coming period are displayed.<br />
By clicking on the reserved workstation's title, you access its geolocation on the plan.<br />
