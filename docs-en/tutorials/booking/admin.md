# The Planning Administrator

From the Surfy application, the "Planning Administrator" role allows you to:

-   list and filter past or upcoming bookings across all bookable neighborhoods

and in graphical form, know:
-   the number of workstation bookings by date
-   the number of workstation bookings by day of the week
-   the number of people who have booked by date
-   the number of people who have booked by date and by neighborhood
-   the number of workstation bookings by date and by neighborhood

To access this information, the "Planning Administrator" role must be assigned to the concerned user.<br />
They then have access to these lists and graphs.
