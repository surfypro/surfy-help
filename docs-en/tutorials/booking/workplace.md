# Booking in Surfy

<Youtube code="gC2BWSNqv54"/>

## Book from the Surfy Application

To book a workstation in Surfy, the collaborator must have [access to Surfy](/docs/access/intro) validating the booking, and be assigned to a building, floor or neighborhood to be able to book in this building, floor or neighborhood.

You can book a workstation (or declare telework) for half-day or full day.

For this, if the collaborator has access to other Surfy features (Reader mode for example):

-   click on the "Manage my planning for the coming weeks" icon at the top left of the screen, just above the search magnifying glass, or in the left menu click on "Planning", then "People's work location", then "Manage my planning for the coming weeks".

If the collaborator only has access to booking features, they arrive directly on the "Manage my planning for the coming weeks" page.

The rest of the user experience is identical to that of using via Teams:

The dates of the next X days (X being configurable in the company's record) are displayed and allow booking in the authorized neighborhood.

-   click on the icon opposite the desired date, to book for full day or half-day
-   to declare telework, click on "TELEWORK" on the desired date.
-   to book a workstation, click on "DESK"
-   click on the desired booking neighborhood

The neighborhood authorized for booking is displayed.

-   click on the chosen workstation for booking

The workstation's information is displayed under the reserved day.
Clicking on the booking line gives access to the workstation's position on the plan and displays the name and photo of the person on the reserved workstation.

Colleagues who have already booked in a neighborhood on this day are listed under the neighborhood box. To locate a colleague's booking location on the plan, click on their booking line.<br />
The neighborhood plan appears, workstations available for booking are colored in green.<br />
Already booked workstations are colored in orange on the plan, with the name and possible photo of the colleague who booked.

-   clicking on an available workstation on the plan establishes the booking at this workstation which colors in orange.
-   clicking on an already made booking shows the reserved workstation's position, colored in blue with name and possible photo.
-   clicking on the trash can deletes this booking.

:::tip GOOD TO KNOW
Clicking on the "Share the day in morning/afternoon" icon deletes the day's bookings and modifies the "full day" or "morning/afternoon" choice
:::

From the booking page, it is also possible to:

-   "see all bookings on a plan" for a given date, on a given building and floor.<br />
The floor plan is displayed, with all bookings made on the requested date.<br />

-   "find a colleague or consult their planning" by entering the colleague's name in the designated field.<br />
The colleague's bookings for the coming period are displayed.<br />
By clicking on the reserved workstation's title, you access its geolocation on the plan.<br />


## Book from Teams

Using Teams offers a more direct experience and better adapted to using booking features on smartphone.<br />
