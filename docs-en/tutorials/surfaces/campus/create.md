# Create a Campus

A campus is a set of buildings grouped in a "Campus" entity allowing logical access to a building or group of buildings according to their geographical location.

To create a campus from the home page, in the left menu,

-   click on "Spaces" then "Campus" then "Create a Campus"
-   indicate the <P code="campus:name" /> of the campus, and its <P code="campus:color" /> of representation
-   optionally fill in the <P code="campus:address" /> of the campus, allowing its geolocation on a map
-   validate the creation

The campus is created, it remains to associate buildings with it.

## Associate a Building with a Campus

Once the campus is created, from the context menu,
-   click on "Edit campus XXX"
-   click on "Associate a building"
-   choose a building to associate with the campus, it is added at the bottom of the page to the campus buildings list.
-   to add another building to the campus, click again on "Associate a building"

Buildings are associated with their campus.

:::tip GOOD TO KNOW
A building can only be part of one campus.
If you associate a building with a campus, its old association with another possible campus is deleted.

## View Buildings by Campus

To view buildings grouped by campus,
