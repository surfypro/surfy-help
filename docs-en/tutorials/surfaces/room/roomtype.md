# Space Typologies

To manage space typology, it is recommended to use the "Space Typologies" view.
Learn more about [plan views](/docs/courses/views/planviews.md#vision-typologies-des-espaces).

The typology of a space is the first qualification you can give to a space, often deducible from background plan information.
It allows you to color plans as digitization progresses and obtain cumulative information by typology.

:::warning IMPORTANT
Before creating a new typology, as in any multiple choice, it is important to verify that the typology does not already exist in the database. A duplicate would falsify the totals by splitting data across several identical typologies.
:::

## Create a Space Typology

To create a space typology from the home page:

-   click on "Administration", "Typologies", "Space Typologies", "Space Typology" then "Create a space typology".
-   name the typology in the <P code="roomType:name" /> (ex: "Repro Point").
-   give a <P code="roomType:color" /> to the typology for the 2D view.
-   you can give a different <P code="roomType:color3d" /> for the 3D view. By default, the 2D color is used in 3D.
-   you can define an <P code="roomType:icon" /> which will be displayed on spaces of the typology in 3D view, and in 2D view by clicking on the "Activate icon display on 2D plan" icon above the 2D plan. This allows you to highlight strategic points (Toilets, Repro, elevators, ...) on the provided plans.

For more information on the fields to complete, see the [basic properties of Space Typology](/entities/admin/types/room-types/room-type).

-   "validate the creation" of the typology.

The typology is created.

## Associate a Typology with a Space

To qualify a space with an existing typology:

-   click in the concerned space
-   "Edit" the space, at the top left of the space's record
-   click on the "pencil" icon of the "Space Typology" line
-   choose the appropriate typology with the search
-   "Save" the modifications

The space is qualified by its typology.

## Create and Associate a Typology with a Space

You can create a new typology if it is not present in the choice list when qualifying a space.
This new typology will be directly associated with the space after being created:

-   click in the concerned space
-   "Edit" the space, at the top left of the space's record
-   click on the "pencil" icon of the "Space Typology" line

The desired typology does not appear.

-   click on "Create and associate a space typology" at the top of the screen, the typology creation page appears.
-   name and fill in the typology information, see [Create a Space Typology](/docs/tutorials/surfaces/room/roomtype.md#cr√©er-une-typologie-despace)
-   "Validate creation"

The new typology is created and associated with the selected space.
To view the colored plan with the new typology, it is necessary to refresh the page (F5).

Subsequent spaces can be qualified by this new typology which will appear in the choice list.


## View Space Typology

To display plans and data totals by typology, click on the vertical "Color spaces on the plan according to typologies" icon

The plan appears with typology colors.
To the left of the plan are grouped the legends (names of present typologies with their color).
The cumulative information for each typology is displayed by clicking on the "butterfly" at the end of the typology line, or on the general "butterfly" at the top right of the legends, "Open all details and indicators".

:::tip GOOD TO KNOW
If the chosen typology is used for the first time on the floor, it is necessary to refresh the page (F5) to obtain the typology color on plans.
:::

## Edit a Space Typology

To edit a space typology, for example its name or color, from the home page:

-   click on "Administration", "Typologies", "Space Typologies", "Space Typology" then "List space typologies".
-   search for the typology to modify, a filter is available at the top right of the screen "Filter space typologies".
-   click on the icon at the beginning of the typology line to "edit space typology XXX".
-   modify the information,
-   "Save" the modifications.

For more information on the fields to complete, see the [basic properties of Space Typology](/entities/admin/types/room-types/room-type).

:::tip GOOD TO KNOW
You can also modify a typology from a space qualified by this typology, by clicking in the space then on the icon to the right of the "Space Typology" line of the space's record. This "See more options for typology XXX" icon allows you to "Edit space typology XXX" and access typology modification directly.
:::


## Delete a Space Typology

Deleting a typology deletes all space qualifications and information totals related to this typology.

To delete a space typology, from the home page:

-   click on "Administration", "Typologies", "Space Typologies", "Space Typology" then "List space typologies".
-   search for the typology to delete, a filter is available at the top right of the screen "Filter space typologies".
-   check the box at the beginning of the typology line to delete.
-   click on the Trash icon at the top of the page, "Delete selected space typologies"
-   confirm the deletion

The space typology is deleted.

## Space Typology Groups

You can group several typologies in a typology group, allowing the grouping of several spaces of different typologies (example: all meeting spaces, including bubbles and rooms), or the exclusion of certain typologies (example: basements excluding parking)

Typology groups are proposed for use. From the left menu,

-   click on "Administration", "Typologies", "Space Typology" then "List space typologies"
-   click on the icon at the beginning of the chosen space typology (example: "Meeting Room") to "Edit space typology XXX"
-   click on "Associate space typology group with space typology" then "Create an association space typology group with space typology"
-   click on the "pencil" icon to give the "Meeting Spaces" space typology group to the space typology
-   validate the creation

The space typology group is given to the typology, and is added to the list of typology groups of the typology, below the selection.

### View Typology Groups:

To obtain group information, from the floor plan,

-   click on the vertical "View space indicators on the plan according to space typology groups" icon

The cumulative information for each space typology group is displayed by opening the "butterfly" at the end of the line.
The grouped typology list is obtained by hovering over the "?" icon.
