# Edit a Building

Building information can be modified by clicking on the pencil at the bottom of the building's record, or on the icon at the end of the building's color line then on "edit building XXX". The following information can then be completed:

-   <P code="building:name" /> of the building: modifying the name allows you to organize your buildings and scenarios
-   <P code="building:color" />: the building's color allows you to personalize its environment and avoid mistaking buildings

The following information is declarative and optional:
-   Surface: indicates the "official" occupied surface
-   Lease start date 
-   Lease end date
-   Building purchase date
-   Associated documents: allows you to record links to associated documents
-   Building photo: You can add a building photo for a simplified view in Reader mode for example.
-   Number of parking spaces
-   Building construction year
-   Annual charges
-   Annual rent
-   Annual parking rent
-   Annual tax amount
-   Annual operating charges
-   Rent reference index
-   Security deposit


-   <P code="building:address" />: allows you to view buildings on a map and access them directly via this map.
-   Building type: tenant or owner, the information to fill in will be different.
-   Building owner user: by default, allows you to know the person who created the building.
-   Default plan view: you can choose a pre-programmed default view for accessing plans.
-   Campus: allows you to associate or remove the association of a building to a campus.
-   Original building: allows you to organize scenarios by "hiding" them behind their "original building". In the absence of an "original building", the concerned building is present on the home page and becomes a "Main building". Scenarios are accessible by clicking on the icon at the bottom right of the original building's record.
-   Click on "save" to record the building modifications.

:::tip Good to know
You can create several levels of scenarios by organizing "scenarios of scenarios of scenarios etc...", and thus create a project hierarchy.
