# Edit a Building

Building information can be modified by clicking on the pencil at the bottom of the building file, or on the color icon at the end of the building line then on "edit building XXX". The following information can then be completed:

-   <P code="building:name" /> of the building: modifying the name allows organizing your buildings and scenarios
-   <P code="building:color" />: the building color allows personalizing its environment and avoiding confusion between buildings

The following information is declarative and optional:
-   Surface: indicates the "official" occupied surface
-   Lease start date
-   Lease end date
-   Building purchase date
-   Associated documents: allows recording links to associated documents
-   Building photo: You can add a building photo for a simplified view in Reader mode for example.
-   Number of parking spaces
-   Building construction year
-   Annual charges
-   Annual rent
-   Annual parking rent
-   Annual tax amount
-   Annual operating charges
-   Rent reference index
-   Security deposit

-   <P code="building:address" />: allows visualizing buildings on a map and accessing them directly via this map.
-   Building type: tenant or owner, the information to fill in will be different.
-   Building owner user: by default, allows knowing the person who created the building.
-   Default plan view: you can choose a pre-programmed default view for accessing plans.
-   Campus: allows associating or removing a building's association with a campus.
-   Original building: allows organizing scenarios by "hiding" them behind their "original building". In the absence of an "original building", the concerned building is present on the home page and becomes a "Main building". Scenarios are accessible by clicking on the icon at the bottom right of the original building's file.
-   Click on "save" to record building modifications.

:::tip Good to know
You can create several levels of scenarios by organizing "scenarios of scenarios of scenarios etc...", and thus create a project hierarchy.
