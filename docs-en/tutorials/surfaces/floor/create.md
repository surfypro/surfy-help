# Create a Floor

<Youtube code="6wnzskeAskg"/>

To create a floor from an already existing building:
-   click on the pencil at the bottom of the building's record to "edit building XXX"
-   below the building information, click on "Create a floor"
-   indicate the <P code="floor:name" /> of the floor: for example "R + 1"
-   indicate the <P code="floor:level" /> of the floor relative to other floors already present: R+1 will have level "1"
-   the building is already filled in since we're editing this building to create the floor.


:::info Good to know
To be able to create a floor, the three pieces of information <P code="floor:name" />, <P code="floor:level" /> and Building are mandatory.
:::

-   validate the creation
-   create other floors if needed by modifying the <P code="floor:name" /> and <P code="floor:level" /> of the new floors to create
-   once the floors are created, click on the company logo at the top left of the screen to return to the home page.
-   Created floors appear in the building's record.
-   Access the floor by clicking on the desired floor in the building's record
-   the floor is ready to import the background plan and create the <P code="floor:mapScale"/>
