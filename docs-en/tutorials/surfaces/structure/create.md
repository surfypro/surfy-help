# Create a Structure

A floor's structure allows you to consolidate information to display in 3D by delimiting the floor's contours.
It also allows you to mark the building's "footprint" on the ground and precisely geolocate the building in 3D on a "Maps" type map.

A structure can be used on several floors.

To create a floor's structure,

from the left menu,

-   click on "Spaces", "Structures" then "create a structure"
-   name the <P code="structure:name" /> and validate the creation
-   choose the floor's background plan by clicking on the "Choose a reference plan..." icon
-   click on the "Plus" icon to "Create the structure shape"
-   draw the structure around the floor then save the structure

## Associate the Structure with a Floor

Once the structure is drawn, you associate this structure with one or more floors of a building according to its shape.

To associate a structure with a floor,

-   display the concerned floor
-   in the context menu, click on "edit floor XXX"
-   in the "Structure" field, choose the appropriate structure
-   "save" the modifications

## Calibrate the Structure

To calibrate the structure of a building's floor, the concerned building's address must be filled in, by clicking on the Pencil icon "Edit building" on the building's record.

Then, from the left menu,

-   click on "Spaces", "Structures" then "List structures"
-   click on the icon at the beginning of the concerned structure's line to "Calibrate the structure on a map to associate geographical coordinates".
-   choose the floor on which the calibration must apply


:::tip Important
The structure to consider for a building's calibration is that of the floor closest to the ground in positive, generally the Ground floor.
:::

The floor's structure appears on a map at the building's address and scale.

The "Transformation" allows you to modify the X position, Y position as well as the structure's rotation to precisely position the structure on the map.
Validate the modifications by checking the green checkmark.

The structure being calibrated, the building can be geolocated on the map. See [Display a building in 3D on a map](/docs/courses/views/3Dviews.md#afficher-un-b√¢timent-en-3d-sur-une-carte)
