## Surfaces in Surfy

To use Surfy, I need static 2D plans that will serve as background plans for each floor for building my spaces.<br />
In Surfy, I create a building then a floor with its background plan and scale so I can draw and qualify spaces.
I then get surface information by space typology or any other custom layer: Organizations, floor types, evacuation zones, cost centers, etc...<br />
I can also duplicate an existing building or floor to propose a new layout for my spaces and decide with full knowledge of my data.<br />
After redevelopment, I can erase obsolete elements in Paint3D to update my background plan, and redefine my spaces following the new layout.<br />

## People in Surfy

The list of occupants with additional information can be integrated into Surfy from an Excel file or manually as collaborators arrive.<br />
Easily find a collaborator's workstation or district, automatically visualize local security team workstations on plans, structure and catalog teams, assign an ergo seat or cabinet,... all features explained here.<br />
Team relocation is easily managed in Surfy using a simple and effective transfer matrix.<br />

## Furniture in Surfy

Create and duplicate furniture in Surfy, to scale or as icons, from the object library or by creating your own object types or workstation types.<br />
