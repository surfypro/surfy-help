## Surfaces in Surfy

To use Surfy I need static 2D plans that will serve as background plans for each floor for building my spaces.<br />
In Surfy I create a building then a floor with its background plan and scale so I can draw and qualify spaces.
I then get surface information by space typology or by any other custom layer: Organizations, floor types, evacuation zones, cost centers, etc...<br />
I can also duplicate an existing building or floor to propose a new layout of my spaces and decide with full knowledge of my data.<br />
After the redevelopment, I can erase obsolete elements in Paint3D to update my background plan, and redefine my spaces according to the new layout.<br />

## People in Surfy

The list of occupants with additional information can be integrated into Surfy from an Excel file or manually as collaborators arrive.<br />
Easily find a collaborator's position or district, automatically visualize on plans the workstations of local security team members, structure and list teams, assign an ergo seat or a cabinet,... so many features explained here.<br />
Team moves are easily managed in Surfy from a simple and efficient transfer matrix.<br />

## Furniture in Surfy
