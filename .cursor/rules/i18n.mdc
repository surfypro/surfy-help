# Internationalization Rules

## Code and Documentation Language

- All code, including variable names, function names, and comments MUST be in English
- All technical documentation MUST be in English
- All commit messages and PR descriptions MUST be in English

## Content Language

- User-facing content should be internationalized
- Support multiple languages through translation files
- Use translation keys instead of hardcoded strings
- Keep translation files organized by feature/module
- Include language codes in file names (e.g., `en.json`, `fr.json`)

## Translation Management

- Use a consistent format for translation keys
- Keep translations up to date
- Document any special formatting or variables in strings
- Test UI with different language lengths
- Handle pluralization correctly

## Default Language

- Use English as the default/fallback language
- Ensure all strings have English translations
- Document any region-specific variations (e.g., en-US vs en-GB)

## Code Practices

- Use translation hooks consistently
- Avoid string concatenation for translated content
- Handle missing translations gracefully
- Support RTL languages when relevant
