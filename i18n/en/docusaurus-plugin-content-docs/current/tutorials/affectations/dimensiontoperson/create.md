# Create a District Assignment

To assign people to districts, you must first create assignment layers then define districts by qualifying spaces. See the [Assignment Layers](/en/docs/tutorials/dimensiontypetobuilding/create) section to learn everything about creating, modifying or deleting an assignment layer.

Once districts are created on the plans,

-   click on the vertical "Grid" icon to "Color spaces on the plan according to assignment layers" and view information totals by assignment layer.
-   "select the layer type for navigation" to activate selection by entire districts, by clicking on the icon at the end of the layer name line
-   district information, its assignments and inventory are accessible in the same way as for a classic space, by clicking in the district to display this information on the left side of the screen.

:::tip Plan View
Clicking on the vertical "Change plan view" icon and selecting "Districts" allows you to configure Surfy in district assignment mode in 2 clicks: Assignment layers are displayed on the plan and the layer type is selected for navigation. As long as the view is not changed, it remains effective even after refresh (F5). You must therefore remember to return to the default view "Space Typologies" for standard use. See [district view](/en/docs/courses/views/planviews#district-view).

To assign a person to a district, 

-   click in the district to select it on the plan
-   click on the "Assign a person to XXX" icon at the top left of the district card
-   Search and select from the list the <P code="dimensionToPerson:person" /> to assign

The person is assigned to the district.

If the person is not yet created in the Surfy database, you can "Create and associate" this person with the assignment layer:

-   click on "Create and associate"
-   fill in the person's card
-   "validate the creation" of the person

The person is created and assigned to the corresponding district.
