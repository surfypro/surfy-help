# Creating an assignment to a district

To assign a person to a district, you must first create assignment layers and then define the district by qualifying the spaces. Refer to the [Assignment Layers](/docs/tutorials/dimensionTypeToBuilding/create.md) section to learn everything about creating, modifying, or deleting an assignment layer.

Once the district have been created on the plans:

- Click on the vertical "Grid" icon to "Color the spaces on the plan according to the assignment layers" and visualize the cumulative information by assignment layer.  
- "Select the layer type for navigation" to enable selection by entire district by clicking on the icon at the end of the layer's name line.  
- district information, Assignments, and inventory are accessible in the same way as for a standard space by clicking on the district to display the information on the left side of the screen.  

:::tip Plan View
Click the vertical "Change the view of the plan" icon and select "Neighborhoods" to configure Surfy in district assignment mode in just two clicks: Assignment layers are displayed on the plan, and the layer type is selected for navigation. As long as the view is not changed, it remains effective even after refreshing (F5). Therefore, remember to return to the default "Typologies of spaces" view for standard use. See  [district View](/docs/courses/views/planviews.md#vision-quartiers).

- Click on the district to select it on the plan.
