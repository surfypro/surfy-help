# Create a Neighborhood Assignment

To assign people to neighborhoods, you must first create assignment layers then define neighborhoods by qualifying spaces. Consult the [Assignment Layers](/docs/tutorials/dimensionTypeToBuilding/create.md) section to learn everything about creating, modifying or deleting an assignment layer.

Once neighborhoods are created on plans,

-   click on the vertical "Grid" icon to "Color spaces on the plan according to assignment layers" and visualize information totals by assignment layer.
-   "select the layer type for navigation" to activate selection by entire neighborhoods, by clicking on the icon at the end of the layer name line
-   the neighborhood's information, its assignments and inventory are accessible in the same way as for a classic space, by clicking in the neighborhood to display this information on the left side of the screen.

:::tip Plan View
Clicking on the vertical "Change plan view" icon and selecting "Neighborhoods" allows you to configure Surfy in neighborhood assignment mode in 2 clicks: Assignment layers are displayed on the plan and the layer type is selected for navigation. As long as the view is not changed, it remains effective even after refresh (F5). You must therefore remember to return to the default view "Space Typologies" for standard use. See [neighborhood view](/docs/courses/views/planviews.md#vision-quartiers).

To assign a person to a neighborhood, 

-   click in the neighborhood to select it on the plan
-   click on the "Assign a person to XXX" icon at the top left of the neighborhood's record
-   Search and select in the list the <P code="dimensionToPerson:person" /> to assign

The person is assigned to the neighborhood.

If the person is not yet created in Surfy's database, you can "Create and associate" this person to the assignment layer:

-   click on "Create and associate"
-   fill in the person's record
-   "validate the creation" of the person

The person is created and assigned to the corresponding neighborhood.
