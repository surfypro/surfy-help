# Delete a Building Assignment

A person's building assignment can be deleted when assigning the person to a new building: existing assignments on the same building are proposed by default for deletion, just "delete selected assignments" to keep only the new assignment.

## Delete a person's building assignment

From the home page,

-   click on "Assignments", "Building Assignments", then "List building assignments".
-   search for the building assignment to delete
-   check the box at the beginning of the line then click on the "Delete selected building assignments" icon at the top of the page

The building assignment is deleted.

:::tip Good to know
From the home page and for updating building information, it is necessary to "reload visible data" by clicking on the icon at the top right of the screen. Once the data is recalculated, refresh with the rotating arrow at the top left of the screen, or by F5 to get the correct information on the building sheet.
