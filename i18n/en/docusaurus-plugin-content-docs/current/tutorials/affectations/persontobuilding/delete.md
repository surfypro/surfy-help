# Delete a Building Assignment

A person's assignment to a building can be deleted when reassigning the person: existing assignments on the same building are proposed for deletion by default, just "delete selected assignments" to keep only the new assignment.

## Delete a Person's Assignment to a Building

From the home page,

-   click on "Assignments", "Building Assignments", then "List Building Assignments".
-   search for the building assignment to delete
-   check the box at the beginning of the line then click on the icon "Delete Selected Building Assignments" at the top of the page

The building assignment is deleted.

:::tip Good to Know
From the home page and for updating building information, it is necessary to "reload visible data" by clicking on the icon at the top right of the screen. Once the data is recalculated, refresh with the rotating arrow at the top left of the screen, or with F5 to get the correct information on the building card.
