# Assignments in Surfy

You can assign a person in different ways in Surfy depending on the mode of occupancy of the premises.
These assignment modes can be used simultaneously in Surfy:

- Assignment to a workstation
- Assignment to a space
- Assignment to a district
- Assignment to a building

## Assignment to a Workstation

Workstation assignment allows you to assign a fixed workstation to a person.

## Assignment to a Space

Space assignment allows you to assign a unique space to one or more people, without defining exactly which workstations are used by these people.

## Assignment to a District

District assignment allows you to delimit a large composite area in which assigned people can book or work.

To assign people to a district, it is necessary to create an assignment layer type and associated assignment layers.

### Assignment Layer

An assignment layer is an analysis layer whose layer type is attached to one or more buildings.
The assignment layer is only available on the spaces of the concerned building(s).

An assignment layer allows you to group and represent spaces on the plan to delimit districts in which people can be assigned. It also allows the accumulation of data concerning the delimited district.

Just like analysis layers, assignment layers are grouped in a layer type.
For example, the assignment layer type "Building A Districts" groups the assignment layers "District A1", "District A2" or "District A3".

## Assignment to a Building

Building assignment allows you to preselect people by assigning them a building of belonging before assigning them a more precise assignment, in the case of multi-site management for example.

## Search for an Assignment

You can access a person's assignment in several ways:

-   by the magnifying glass by searching for the person then clicking on the assignment of the searched person
-   by the magnifying glass by searching for the space or district then clicking on the "ASSIGNMENTS" tab of the space or district card
-   by the magnifying glass by searching for the workstation name then clicking on the concerned workstation
-   by the [filtered list](/en/docs/courses/find/listfindcourse) of assignments by choosing the assignment type then listing and filtering the list
