Once meeting spaces have been configured, to view meeting rooms from the home page:

All viewable rooms appear on the screen with the equipment of each room and a filter by building, floor, capacity and space typology is available to find the appropriate room.<br />

## Book a Meeting Room via Surfy

Meeting room booking is done in Outlook.

A bidirectional interaction between Surfy and Outlook allows booking, modifying, viewing or cancelling from either application with a shared result.

In addition to the features offered by Outlook, Surfy lets you find the appropriate room (building, floor, room type, capacity, equipment), geolocate it in the building, view its availability, and book the room via the Outlook interface without changing context.

To be bookable, a room must first be declared as "Bookable".<br />
To configure room management, see the chapter on [Meeting Rooms Administrator](/en/docs/tutorials/booking/meetingroom/admin).

From the meeting room view page, bookable spaces can be booked by clicking on the "Calendar" icon under the chosen room to "Book via the calendar".

The Outlook interface opens and booking in Outlook is available.

Room availability can be viewed by clicking on the "clock" icon to "View the booking calendar".<br />
Outlook displays all existing bookings for the room concerned.

Booking via Outlook is instantly synchronized with Surfy.
Any action in Outlook is reflected in Surfy and vice versa.
