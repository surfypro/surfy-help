# Book with Teams in Surfy

In Teams, you can add the Surfy application by clicking on "Application" and searching for "Surfy".<br />
Once selected, the application is added to Teams and allows the authorized collaborator to directly use Surfy's booking features via Teams.<br />
Using the collaborator's professional Office365 account allows them direct access to Surfy via automatic authentication.<br />
The collaborator must be assigned to a building, floor or district to be able to book in that building, floor or district.


For more information, please [contact us](https://www.surfy.pro/en-gb/contact) to configure Surfy and allow you to use the Teams application for booking in Surfy.

To book a workstation (or declare remote work) in the accessible district on a given date:

-   click if needed on "Manage my planning for the coming weeks".

The dates of the next X days (X being configurable in the company card) are displayed and allow booking in the authorized district.

-   click on the icon next to the desired date, to book for a full day or half day
-   to declare remote work, click on "REMOTE WORK" on the desired date.
-   to book a workstation, click on "OFFICE"
-   click on the desired booking district

The district authorized for booking is displayed.

-   click on the chosen workstation for booking

Workstation information is displayed under the reserved day.
Clicking on the booking line gives access to the workstation position on the plan and displays the name and photo of the person on the reserved workstation.

Colleagues who have already booked in a district that day are listed under the district box. To locate a colleague's booking location on the plan, click on their booking line.<br />
The district plan appears, workstations available for booking are colored in green.<br />
Already reserved workstations are colored in orange on the plan, with the name and possible photo of the colleague who booked.

-   clicking on an available workstation on the plan establishes the booking at that workstation which turns orange.
-   clicking on an already made booking shows the position of the reserved workstation, colored in blue with name and possible photo.
-   clicking on the trash deletes this booking.

:::tip GOOD TO KNOW
Clicking on the "Share the day in morning/afternoon" icon deletes the day's bookings and modifies the choice "full day" or "morning / afternoon"
:::

From the booking page, it is also possible to:

-   "see all bookings on a plan" on a given date, on a given building and floor.<br />
The floor plan is displayed, with all bookings made on the requested date.<br />

-   "find a colleague or consult their planning" by entering the colleague's name in the designated field.<br />
The colleague's bookings for the upcoming period are displayed.<br />
By clicking on the reserved workstation title, you access its geolocation on the plan.<br />
