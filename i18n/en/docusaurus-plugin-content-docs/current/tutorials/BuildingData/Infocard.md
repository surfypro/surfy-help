# Information Cards

Each building, floor or space has a summary card of the information of the considered entity.

## Building Information Card

By default, "Reader" roles do not have access to building information cards, but to cards representing the possible building photo, its address (if filled in) and access to floors.<br />
To view the information, the "Reader" role must be supplemented by the "Info Display" role.<br />
To add this role to a user, see the chapter [Modify User Role](/en/docs/access/intro#modify-user-role)

For people with an "Administrator" role (or the complementary "Info Display" role) the information cards of main buildings are directly consultable by clicking on the company logo at the top left of the screen.<br />

By clicking on the "Building XXX scenarios and project" icon at the bottom right of a building's information card, you get the information cards of the possible scenarios of the considered building.

The building information card is composed of the following information:

-   Building name
-   Qualified surface
-   Number of workstations
-   Workstation ratio
-   Total number of assignments
-   Occupation ratio
-   Occupation rate
-   Foisonnement rate
-   Number of free workstations
-   Number of flex workstations
-   Taux de postes de travail en flex
-   Nombre de postes de travail partagés
-   Taux de postes de travail partagés
-   Nombre de postes de travail de passage
-   Nombre de places assises
-   Taux de places assises par affectations
-   Empreinte carbone

En passant la souris sur chaque ligne, on obtient le descriptif de l'information dans l'info bulle.<br />
This information is calculated automatically by Surfy. It may be necessary to recalculate the data to get up-to-date information in case of plan modifications. To do this, click on the "reload data" icon at the top right of the screen then refresh (F5).<br />
Non-effective information is not present in the building card (example: no workstation = no corresponding line)

You can also access building information by viewing the [3D building](/en/docs/courses/views/3Dviews#display-a-buildings-3d-plan) then clicking on the vertical icon "View building information".<br />
To the listed information is added here the number of digitized spaces in the entire building.

## Floor Information Card

The floor information card is visible by accessing the floor, then clicking on the vertical icon "View floor information".<br />
The displayed information is of the same type as for the building, but brought back to the floor.<br />
To the listed information is added the number of digitized spaces on the entire floor.<br />

## Space Information Card

By clicking in a space on the plan, you get the space information.<br />
The displayed information is of the same type as for the building, but brought back to the space.<br />
To the listed information is added the perimeter of the space.<br />

:::tip GOOD TO KNOW
From the space information card, you can access space assignments and inventory: Clicking on the ASSIGNMENTS tab will list the space's workstations, their qualification (flex, passing) and assignments to the space or to the space's workstations. Clicking on the INVENTORY tab will list the furniture inventory belonging to the space. Clicking on the space name tab will give the space information card again.
