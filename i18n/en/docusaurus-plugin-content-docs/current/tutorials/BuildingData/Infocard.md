# Information Records

Each building, floor or space has a summary record of the considered entity's information.

## The Building Information Record

By default, "Reader" roles don't have access to building information records, but to records representing the building's possible photo, its address (if filled in) and access to floors.<br />
To visualize information, the "Reader" role must be completed by the "Display info" role.<br />
To add this role to a user, see the chapter [Edit a User's Role](/docs/access/intro#modifier-le-rôle-dun-utilisateur)

For people with an "Administrator" role (or the complementary "Display info" role) the main buildings' information records are directly consultable by clicking on the company logo at the top left of the screen.<br />

By clicking on the "Building XXX scenarios and project" icon at the bottom right of a building's information record, you obtain the information records of the considered building's possible scenarios.

The building information record is composed of the following information:

-   Building name
-   Qualified surface
-   Number of workstations
-   Workstation ratio
-   Total number of assignments
-   Occupation ratio
-   Occupation rate
-   Expansion rate
-   Number of free workstations
-   Number of flex workstations
-   Flex workstation rate
-   Number of shared workstations
-   Shared workstation rate
-   Number of passing workstations
-   Number of seats
-   Seats per assignment rate
-   Carbon footprint

By hovering over each line, you obtain the description of the information in the tooltip.<br />
This information is automatically calculated by Surfy. It may be necessary to recalculate the data to obtain up-to-date information in case of plan modifications. For this, click on the "reload data" icon at the top right of the screen then refresh (F5).<br />
Non-effective information is not present in the building record (example: no workstation = no corresponding line)

You can also access building information by visualizing the [building in 3D](/docs/courses/views/3Dviews#afficher-le-plan-3d-dun-bâtiment) then clicking on the vertical "View building information" icon.<br />
To the listed information is added here the number of digitized spaces across the entire building.

## The Floor Information Record

The floor information record is visible by accessing the floor, then clicking on the vertical "View floor information" icon.<br />
The displayed information is of the same type as for the building, but brought back to the floor.<br />
To the listed information is added the number of digitized spaces across the entire floor.<br />

## The Space Information Record

By clicking in a space on the plan, you obtain the space's information.<br />
The displayed information is of the same type as for the building, but brought back to the space.<br />
To the listed information is added the space's perimeter.<br />

:::tip GOOD TO KNOW
From the space information record, you can access the space's assignments and inventory: Clicking on the ASSIGNMENTS tab will list the space's workstations, their qualification (flex, passing) and assignments to the space or the space's workstations. Clicking on the INVENTORY tab will list the furniture inventory belonging to the space. Clicking on the space name tab will give again the space information record.
