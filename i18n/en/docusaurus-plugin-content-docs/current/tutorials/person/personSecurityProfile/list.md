## Assign a Security Profile to a Person

To assign a Security profile to a person, it must already be created to be present in the choice list.

To create a Security profile, see the chapter [Create a Security Profile](/en/docs/tutorials/person/personSecurityProfile/create)


To assign a security profile to a person,

-   access the person's card
-   modify the card by clicking in the context menu (gray box under the search magnifying glass) then "modify person XXX" 
-   click on the "pencil" icon of the "Security profile" line
-   select the desired security profile for the person
-   save modifications

:::tip Good to know
If the Security profile to assign to a person is not in the choice list, it means it is not yet created.
Above this list, you can "create and associate" a new security profile: creation will then directly assign the new Security profile to the person.
