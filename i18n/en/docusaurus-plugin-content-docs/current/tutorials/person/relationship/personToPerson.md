# Person to Person Relationship

A person to person relationship allows creating a "natural relationship" from the "source" person to the "destination" person.
The "inverse relationship" is exercised from the "destination" person to the "source" person.

## Relationship Type

The "relationship type" defines the "natural relationship" between two people: for example, "is manager of".
We also define the "inverse relationship" between these people: in this case, "is managed by".

This relationship type is then used to define the relational link between people. In the example, we get the list of teams, their manager, but also the manager's manager, etc...

To create the relationship type, from the left menu,

-   click on "Collaborators", "Relationships", "Person to person relationship types", then "Create a person to person relationship type".
-   fill in the "natural relationship" (example: "is manager of") and the "inverse relationship" (example: "is managed by")
-   validate creation.
-   the relationship type is created.
