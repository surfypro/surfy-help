# Create Plan Background

A floor's plan background is the graphic reference of the floor in Surfy and allows you to define at minimum the building contours at this floor, as well as all load-bearing walls and structure. It can include partitions or layout on which to rely for digitizing spaces and furniture.
The plan background must include a scale that will be reproduced in Surfy.

## Create the PNG File

The plan background in Surfy is in PNG format.
The PNG file can be created from Autocad or from a raster image such as pdf or jpg.
PNG conversion is obtained using free software like "Convertio".

### From an Autocad Plan

Creating a plan background from Autocad requires quick training from our services.
You must have an Autocad license.

Points to respect are:
-   a correct scale placed in Autocad, visible on the PNG output
-   a common frame for all floors, wide enough to encompass the widest floor
-   identical positioning of floors in the frame to ensure good verticality between floors
-   PNG output from Autocad
-   correct pixel count in PNG output (2000 to 5000 pixels X 3000 to 7000 pixels, depending on plan size)

Surfy offers PNG plan background creation for users who do not have an Autocad license.
Please contact us for [training or dwg to png conversion](https://www.surfy.pro/contact)

### From an Image

-   convert the image to PNG format
-   clean the PNG image with "Paint3D" or equivalent to remove unwanted graphic elements
-   index and save the PNG image.

:::warning Important
Image size is expressed in pixels by pixels. It is essential to maintain this size in successive plan backgrounds to "stick" to spaces drawn in Surfy.
