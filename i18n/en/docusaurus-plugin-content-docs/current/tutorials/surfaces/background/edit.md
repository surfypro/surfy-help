# Modify Plan Background


<Youtube code="51r_1z50Otg"/>


Following a redevelopment in Surfy, you may need to modify a floor's plan background to remove parasitic images that would correspond to an old layout.
To do this, you extract the existing plan background image to modify it under "Paint 3D" and reintroduce it as a plan background in Surfy.

## Extract Plan Background

-   access the floor
-   in the context menu, click on "modify floor XXX"
-   under the "change image" button, at the end of the line, click on "copy URL" of the plan background
-   paste the url in a new browser tab and click "enter".  
-   the image is displayed at the correct dimensions, right-click to "save as"
-   name the image and save.

## Modify Plan Background with Paint3D

-   right-click on the saved file and "Open with" Paint3D (or any other drawing software respecting the file dimensions)
-   go directly to "drawing area" in Paint3D.
-   to the left of the screen, the width and height in pixels must be preserved to maintain the correct image size and remain compatible with space drawing in Surfy.
-   modify the plan by selecting the area to delete + Backspace, or by copying/pasting the elements composing the plan.
-   add a version on the plan cartouche for good archiving.
-   "save as" the file while keeping the unmodified version for archiving.

:::tip Good to know
You can modify the image under Paint3D pixel by pixel, so delete or add exactly the desired elements

## Re-import Plan Background in Surfy


-   access the floor of the plan background to load
-   in the context menu, click on "modify floor XXX"
-   click on "change image"
-   load the modified plan background image and click "skip" to avoid image cropping.
-   "save" floor modifications.
-   from the context menu, click on "floor plan in 2D"
-   the new plan background is displayed on the floor.
