# Create a Floor Scale

<Youtube code="NEuqxKqpIJM"/>

To create the scale of a floor whose plan background is already entered in Surfy,

-   click on the floor
-   click on the plan background to make the icons above the plan appear
-   click on the "Manage scale" icon
-   zoom on the scale segment in reference on the plan background
-   click on the beginning of the scale segment, a red line appears.
-   click on the second end of the scale segment
-   the scale segment is defined
-   optionally name the <P code="mapScale:name" /> for use on other floors.
-   fill in the corresponding <P code="mapScale:distance" /> in meters in the "Distance" box
-   validate the entered value by clicking on the green checkmark.


Once your scale is validated you can start digitizing your spaces.
All spaces or furniture drawn on the floor will be based on this scale.

:::tip Good to Know
If there is no scale segment drawn on the plan background, you can use the length of a load-bearing wall measured on site or any other reliable dimension to place the segment and report the length in the "Distance" box.

:::tip Tip
If you have digitized spaces or furniture before creating the scale, you can create it afterwards. After refresh, the data will adjust to the new scale.
