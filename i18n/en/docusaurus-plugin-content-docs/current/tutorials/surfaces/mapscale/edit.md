# Modify Floor Scale 

## Change Floor Scale

To change a floor scale by another already existing scale,

-   access the concerned floor
-   in the context menu, click on "modify floor XXX"
-   on the "Plan Scale" line, click on the pencil and choose the correct scale.
-   save the modifications.


## Modify Floor Scale Value

To modify the scale value of a floor,

-   access the floor
-   click on the plan background to make the icons above the plan appear
-   click on the "Manage scale" icon
-   modify the <P code="mapScale:length" /> value in meters
-   click on the green checkmark to validate the new entered value
-   optionally name the <P code="mapScale:name" /> for use on other floors.


:::tip Tip
You can adjust the scale very precisely by modifying the distance value or refining it even several digits after the decimal point. You can also "zoom on the scale" and modify the length of the scale segment to adjust it to a new scale in reference on the plan background.
