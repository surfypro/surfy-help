# Delete Floor Scale

To delete a floor scale,

-   click on the floor
-   click on the plan background to make the icons appear above the plan
-   click on the "Manage scale" icon
-   click on "Delete scale".

:::tip Good to Know
If the scale is only assigned to the concerned floor, it will be destroyed and will no longer appear in the scale choices. A scale common to several floors cannot be deleted, but will be dissociated from the floor by clicking on "Dissociate scale". The concerned floor will no longer have a scale but it will still be valid on the other floors that use it.
