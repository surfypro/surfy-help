<Youtube code="yw4XtiZNnu8"/>

To edit floor information and import the background plan,


## Edit Floor Information

-   access the concerned floor
-   in the context menu, click on "edit floor XXX"

The following information can be filled in or modified:

-   modify the <P code="floor:name" /> of the floor and its <P code="floor:level" /> relative to other floors
-   fill in a "ceiling height" useful for the 3D view of the floor
-   fill in the possible "regulatory capacity" according to imposed criteria (number of sanitary facilities, ...). Regulatory capacities will be cumulated on the entire building to give a global regulatory capacity on the building.
-   give a background plan opacity allowing you to obtain a more or less apparent background plan
-   choose the building ownership of the floor by clicking on the pencil of the "Building" line
-   choose a scale already created on another floor, in case the scales are identical
-   give a "structure" to the building to properly delimit spaces in 3D view.


## Modify the Building Ownership of a Floor

You can change the building ownership of a floor to integrate a floor from a validated scenario into the main building.
All floor information will be replaced: layout, assignments, space qualification, etc...

-	go to the floor to move
-	click on the context menu (gray box "Floor" to the left below the search magnifying glass)
-	click on "edit floor XXX", the floor information appears
-	on the "Building" line, click on the pencil to change the building ownership
-	"Save" the modifications at the top right of the screen.
-	the concerned floor has changed building.

:::tip Good to know
You can swap two floors between two buildings, and thus keep your old layout safely rather than deleting it, or to delete it later. Modifying the floor name allows you to avoid confusing the floors to swap.

## Import the Background Plan
