<Youtube code="mV6c8d2ZYbE"/>

To modify floor information and import the plan background,


## Modify Floor Information

-   access the concerned floor
-   in the context menu, click on "modify floor XXX"

Information can be filled in or modified:

-   modify the floor's <P code="floor:name" /> and its <P code="floor:level" /> relative to other floors
-   fill in a "ceiling height" useful for the floor's 3D view
-   fill in the possible "regulatory capacity" according to imposed criteria (number of restrooms, ...). Regulatory capacities will be cumulated on the entire building to give a global regulatory capacity on the building.
-   give a plan background opacity allowing you to get a more or less apparent plan background
-   choose the floor's belonging building by clicking on the pencil of the "Building" line
-   choose a scale already created on another floor, in case the scales are identical
-   give a "structure" to the building to correctly delimit spaces in 3D view.


## Modify a Floor's Belonging Building

You can change a floor's belonging building to integrate a validated scenario floor into the main building.
All floor information will be replaced: layout, assignments, space qualification, etc...

-	go to the floor to move
-	click on the context menu (gray box "Floor" on the left below the search magnifying glass)
-	click on "modify floor XXX", floor information appears
-	on the "Building" line, click on the pencil to change the belonging building
-	"Save" the modifications at the top right of the screen.
-	the concerned floor has changed building.

:::tip Good to Know
You can swap two floors between two buildings, and thus keep your old layout safely rather than deleting it, or to delete it later. Modifying the floor name allows you to avoid confusing the floors to swap.
