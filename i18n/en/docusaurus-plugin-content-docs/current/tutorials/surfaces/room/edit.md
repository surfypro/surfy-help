# Edit a Space

<Youtube code="_B7Jb3eAn4I"/>

To modify the surface of a space in Surfy,

-   activate "plan editing mode" by clicking on the "pencil" icon above the plan.
-   click in the space to make its vertices appear.
-   by clicking on a vertex, the vertex turns red and can be dragged-moved. The surface value changes instantly in the space information window.
-   by pressing "Shift" when selecting multiple vertices, you can move all these vertices at the same time.
-   You can delete one or more vertices by selecting them with "shift" then clicking on the "trash" icon to "delete selected vertices".
-   You can recreate other vertices of a space by selecting the vertex preceding the vertices to add, then clicking on the light gray "+" icon to "add a vertex". By pressing "ctrl", the freedom of movement allows us to recreate one or more consecutive vertices from the red selected vertex to complete the space design. Once the vertices are added, click on "stop adding a vertex".
-   You can add a vertex on a segment by clicking on a vertex then on the dark gray "+" icon to "add a vertex on a segment". By moving the mouse over the desired segment, the segment lights up red and a red circle appears. By clicking, you create a vertex. Once the vertices are created, click on "stop adding vertices on a segment".
-   to separate a space into two from two vertices, select the two vertices with "Shift" and click on "separate space". The two created spaces are separated by a common segment.
-   You can completely separate the two spaces by clicking on the "separate vertex" icon in two to have a vertex on the left space and a vertex on the right space.
-   to group several vertices into one, select the vertices with "shift" and click on the "merge vertices" icon.

## Qualify a Space or Modify Space Information

Once the space is created, you can modify or complete its information:

-   click on the "Edit" button on the space's record, to the left of the plan, to give it a <P code="room:name" />, a possible <P code="room:capacity" />, a <P code="room:organization" />, a <P code="room:roomType" /> of the space, a <P code="room:costCenter" />.
-   click on the pencil of the line to modify to choose the correct qualification in case of multiple choices (typology, organization, cost center, ...)
-   "save" the information. 
-   Analysis layers can also be filled in, layer saving is automatic and allows you to quickly qualify from one space to another.

It is important to fill in at least one space qualification like "typology", to give a color to the spaces on plans. 
After refreshing, the space displays the color of the chosen typology. This allows you to know which spaces are created and filled in.

:::tip Good to know
The "drop" icon above the plan allows you to "activate color transparency" and see the different elements present on the background plan through Surfy's layer colors.

## Bulk Import Information to Spaces

You can import an Excel file containing the information to complete for spaces.<br />
It is necessary to import the column containing the Surfy identifier of the space, as well as the column containing the information to complete using the correct headers for each column. These columns must be contiguous to be imported into Surfy.<br />
For more details on bulk import, please [contact us](https://www.surfy.pro/contact)

## Search for a Space

You can geolocate and access a space's record in several ways:

-   through the magnifying glass by performing a search then clicking on the searched space
-   through the [filtered list](/docs/courses/find/listfindcourse.md) of spaces ("Spaces", "Spaces", "List spaces" then "filter spaces")
-   through the person's assignment by clicking in the assigned person's space


## Separate a Space into Two


You can separate a space in Surfy to create two different spaces.
To do this, you select two vertices of the space to separate the space into two between these two vertices.
These vertices must be positioned on the space segments.

### Create Vertices for Separation

-   access the floor of the space to separate
-   "activate plan editing mode" by clicking on the "pencil" icon above the floor plan
-   click in the space to separate
-   click on the black "+" icon above the plan to "add a vertex on a segment".

A segment is a straight line between two vertices of the space perimeter.
It colors red when the mouse passes over it and then allows you to add the vertex on this segment:

-   zoom on the segment
-   when the mouse passes over the segment, it turns red and displays a red circle to create a vertex. 
-   click in the circle to create the vertex.
-   repeat the operation to create the second vertex on the other segment to separate
-   click on the "stop adding a vertex on a segment" icon above the plan

### Separate the Space

The two vertices serving for separation being created,

-   select one of the two vertices which turns red
-   while holding down the "shift" key, select the second vertex which also turns red
-   click on the "separate space" icon to cut the space in two from the two selected vertices

The space "XXX" is separated into two spaces: "XXX" and "XXX(2)"

Surfy proposes to assign to the new space "XXX(2)" all the furniture and assignments to workstations that correspond to this space by clicking on "apply the space change". By clicking on "Close", the furniture and assignments to workstations remain the property of the original space "XXX".
In all cases, space assignments remain assigned to space "XXX".

The newly created space can be filled in on its name, typology and all necessary layers and information.
