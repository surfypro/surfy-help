# Consult Meeting Rooms

To consult meeting rooms, from the left menu,

-   click on "Spaces", "Spaces", then "View and navigate in meeting rooms"

Meeting rooms are grouped and displayed according to their representation on the plan, accompanied by the following information:

-   the space name
-   its typology
-   its capacity
-   its floor and building belonging

The furniture present in the space is represented identically to the plans. Passing the mouse over the furniture allows you to display the object type of each furniture in the info bubble.

Equipment (example: "Service equipment") is listed under the representation of each meeting room.

Clicking on the "road map" icon allows you to "locate the space on the plan" and displays the space in its context on the general floor plan.
