# Delete a Campus

To delete a campus, from the left menu,

-   click on "Spaces" then "Campus" then "List the campuses"
-   check the box of the campus to delete
-   click on the "Trash" icon at the top of the page to "Delete selected campuses"

:::tip GOOD TO KNOW
Deleting a campus does not delete the buildings associated with the campus. These buildings are then no longer associated with a campus.
