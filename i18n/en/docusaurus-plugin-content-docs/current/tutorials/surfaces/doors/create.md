# Create a Door or Passage

Creating a door or passage in Surfy allows you to mark possible passages from one space to another in order to guide the user in their movement from one place to another by a point-to-point route.

To create a passage between two different spaces, you must first create a common segment between the two spaces.
This common segment will then be qualified with or without a door to reflect reality.


## Creating a Common Segment Between Two Spaces
    
A segment is a part of a space's perimeter, delimited by two vertices.
A common segment is a segment delimited by two vertices common to two spaces.

To create a common segment between two independent spaces, you must "merge vertices" of the two spaces, on each side of the segment to make common.

### Creating Vertices to Merge

-   "activate plan edit mode" by clicking on the "pencil" icon above the plan

-   click in the first of the two spaces
-   to create the segment to convert, it must be framed by two vertices:
    -   click on the dark gray "+" icon above the plan to "add a vertex on a segment"
    -   pass the mouse over the segment
    -   when the segment is red, click to add the vertex at the desired location
    -   you can move the vertex after its creation by drag-moving it

-   click in the second space
-   create a segment of approximately the width of the first space's segment:
    -   click on the dark gray "+" icon above the plan to "add a vertex on a segment"
    -   pass the mouse over the segment
    -   when the segment is red, click to add the two vertices near the first space's vertices

-   once vertices are created, click on a vertex then on the dark gray "+" icon to "stop adding a vertex on a segment".


### Merge Vertices

-   click on the first vertex of the first space. The merged vertex will take its position.
-   press the "shift" key and click on the first vertex of the second space
-   the two vertices are selected in red
-   click on the "merge vertices" icon above the plan
-   the first vertex is common to both spaces, positioned on the first vertex selected for merging.

-   click on the second vertex of the first space. The merged vertex will take its position.
-   press the "shift" key and click on the second vertex of the second space
-   the two vertices are selected in red
-   click on the "merge vertices" icon above the plan
-   the second vertex is common to both spaces, positioned on the first vertex selected for merging.

Once the two vertices of the segments are merged, the resulting segment is a common segment.
In "Plan Edit" mode, common segments are wider and colored red.

You can modify the length or position of a common segment by drag-moving the segment vertices.

:::tip Good to know
When merging vertices, the first vertex selected for merging will give its place to the merged vertex.

 The common segment can be qualified to place a door or passage for point-to-point routes.


## Qualifying a Common Segment as Door or Passage

You can give different qualifications to a segment:

-   without partition: allows defining a passage without partition or door between two different spaces
-   simple partition: allows defining a partition without passage between two spaces, or on the periphery of an open space
-   door opening to the right: allows defining a door opening to the right. The direction can be reversed to match reality
-   door opening to the left: allows defining a door opening to the left. The direction can be reversed to match reality


To qualify a segment,

-   click on the "pencil" icon above the plan to "activate plan edit mode".
-   zoom on the segment to visualize it comfortably
-   select the segment by passing the mouse over it, the segment becomes red
-   click on the segment when it is selected and red
-   fill in the segment type in the segment card to the left of the plan
-   Saving is automatic


if needed you can reverse the door direction or display a double opening,

-   click on "modify"
-   check the "reverse points" box to change the door direction
-   check the "display on both sides" box to represent a double-opening door
-   save information

:::tip Good to know
Segment qualification is valid for the entire length of the segment.
Thus, the door representation will cover the entire length of the qualified segment.

## Qualifying a Simple Segment as Simple Partition

A simple segment belongs to only one space. It therefore cannot create a passage.

Simple segment qualification is identical to that of a common segment.
You can qualify a simple segment as a "door" but it will only be a graphic representation on the plan.

A simple segment can be qualified as "simple partition" if it serves to delimit the peripheral walls of a space without partition, such as for example an open space or circulation.
