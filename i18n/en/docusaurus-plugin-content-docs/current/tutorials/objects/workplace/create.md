# Create a Workstation

## What is a workstation?

A workstation is a group of objects to which particular qualifications can be assigned:

-   declaration as Flex, passing through, reservable workstation depending on the workstation's destination
-   [assignment of a collaborator](/docs/tutorials/affectations/workplaceaffectation/create.md#affecter-une-personne-à-un-poste-de-travail) if the workstation is not declared as Flex or passing through
-   [attachment to a Service](/docs/tutorials/organization/create.md#rattacher-un-service-à-un-poste-de-travail)
-   [attachment to a cost center](/docs/tutorials/costcenter/create.md#attribuer-un-centre-de-coût-à-un-poste-de-travail)
-   coloring of workstations according to their [usage status](/docs/courses/views/2Dviews.md#afficher-létat-des-postes-de-travail-sur-le-plan)
-   coloring of workstations according to the [security profile](/docs/courses/views/2Dviews.md#afficher-les-profils-sécurité-sur-le-plan) of the person assigned to the workstation
-   coloring according to their [cost center](/docs/tutorials/cost-distribution-by-cost-center/create.md#visualiser-les-centres-de-coût-sur-le-plan)

On the building, floor, space or any space grouping record, workstations are counted according to their status.
Workstations can be counted as seats when [composing the workstation type](/docs/tutorials/objects/workplacetype/create.md#composer-le-type-de-poste-de-travail)

The number of workstations allows in particular to calculate ratios and occupancy rates on any space grouping.

In the [building inventory report in Excel file](/docs/tutorials/BuildingData/Buildingdashboard/Buildingreporting.md#rapport-de-linventaire-du-bâtiment), the objects composing the workstation are counted in the "Workstations" and "Merge" tabs.

 ## Add a workstation to the space


To add a workstation in a space, the corresponding workstation type must have been created.

For this, see the chapter [workstation type creation](/docs/tutorials/objects/workplacetype/create.md)

If the workstation type exists,

-   click in the space concerned by the workstation addition.
-   click on the "add a workstation" icon to the right of the "Edit" button
-   search for the workstation type to add
-   Click on the chosen workstation type
-   the created workstation is available at the mouse cursor and ready to be dropped by clicking on the plan.

The created workstation is "free" by default, it can be named, qualified and assigned.

:::tip Good to know
The workstation belongs to the space from which it was requested. If it is not dropped in the space where it was requested, a "space choice validation" window allows you to reassign the workstation to the space where it was dropped by clicking on "Apply space change".
:::

To move the workstation or rotate it,

-   switch to "plan editing" mode by clicking on the "pencil" icon above the plan
-   by clicking on the workstation, a wheel appears that allows you to rotate the workstation by 45° steps, or more smoothly by pressing SHIFT.
-   The blue square button allows you to reposition the workstation in its original position

:::tip Good to know
clicking on the "activate background space color transparency" icon above the plan allows you to see the background plan in transparency to be able to place in Surfy the furniture present on the background plan.

## Duplicate a workstation or group of workstations

You can easily and quickly duplicate a workstation or group of workstations in Surfy.

### Duplicate a workstation

-   "Activate plan editing mode" by clicking on the "pencil" icon above the plan
-   click on the workstation to duplicate and simultaneously press the "shift" (uppercase) key and the "C" key 
-   the duplicated workstation is at the mouse cursor. It retains the orientation of the initial workstation
-   click on the plan at the drop location of the duplicated workstation


:::tip Good to know: the "shift + C"
This functionality allows, by pointing the mouse directly at the position of workstations to create, to duplicate them with a simple keyboard shortcut (press "shift", type "C") and drop them by clicking. The new workstation or group of workstations is now selected, and ready for a new duplication by "shift+C".
:::

### Duplicate a group of workstations

-   "Activate plan editing mode" by clicking on the "pencil" icon above the plan
-   click on one of the workstations to duplicate then on the others while holding down the "shift" key
-   a selection area encompassing the workstations to duplicate is delimited, the workstations to duplicate are selected.

To "copy" the workstations, several options are possible:

-   by clicking on the "copy" icon of the selection area
-   by clicking on the "Duplicate shapes" icon above the plan
-   by simultaneously pressing the "shift" (uppercase) key and the "C" key

The duplicated workstations are at the mouse cursor, ready to be dropped by clicking on the plan.

The duplicated workstations retain the orientation and relative positioning of the initial workstation group.
