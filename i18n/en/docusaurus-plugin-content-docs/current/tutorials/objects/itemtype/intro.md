# Different Types of Objects

Besides workstations which have particular properties (see [Workstation Types](/en/docs/workplacetype)), there are 2 categories of object types: Icons and Scale Objects.

### Icon Object Type

An Icon object type allows you to define a name, an Icon, a color, a manufacturer, a price, an optional model for the 3D view as well as associated information, in order to create icon objects having all these characteristics. It is the "Matrix" allowing the creation of multiple identical objects.

:::tip Good to Know
The size of icons on plans will depend on the value selected in "Manage scale" then "object type icon size". The icon size is applied only for the floor. All icons have the same size.

### Scale Object Type

A scale object type allows you to define a name, a shape and a height, a color, a manufacturer, a price, a model for the 3D view as well as associated information, in order to create scale objects having all these characteristics. It is the "Matrix" allowing the creation of multiple identical objects.

:::tip Good to Know
The dimensions of generated objects will conform to the scale of the floor where they will be placed.

Objects from each object type can be customized (purchase date, reference, asset code, association with a person, ...)
