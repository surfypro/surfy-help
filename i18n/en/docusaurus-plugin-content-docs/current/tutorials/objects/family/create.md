# Create an Object Type Family

The object type family allows you to group object types in a common entity according to their destination or use.
It allows inventory classification by families. The family also allows easier display of objects on plans. 


To create an object type family,

-   in the left menu, click on "Furniture", "Typologies", then "Object Type Families" and "Create an object type family".
-   fill in <P code="itemTypeFamily:name" /> for the family to create
-   validate the creation

After refreshing (F5), the new object type family is proposed in the "Object Type Family" choice when creating/modifying object types, and will group all objects from the concerned family's object types.

:::tip Good to know
The "Object Type Family" information is mandatory when creating each object type
