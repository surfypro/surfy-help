# Create an Object

<Youtube code="ZlIw7BwzeUI"/>

## Add an Object to the Space

To add an object in a space, the object type must be created.

If the object type exists,

-   click in the space concerned by the object addition.
-   click on the "add an object" icon to the right of the "Modify" button
-   search for the object to add by searching for its name and/or family and/or code
-   Click on the chosen object: it is available at the mouse cursor and ready to be dropped by clicking on the plan.

The created object can be filled in with its <P code="item:reference" />, its <P code="item:code" /> and its <P code="item:purchaseDate" />. It can be associated with a person (locker, ergonomic seat, ...)

:::tip Good to Know
The object belongs to the space from which it was requested. If it is not dropped in the space where it was requested, a "space choice validation" window allows you to reassign the object to the space where it was dropped by clicking on "Apply space change".
:::

To move the object or make it rotate,

-   switch to "plan editing mode" by clicking on the "pencil" icon above the plan
-   by clicking on the object, a wheel appears that allows you to rotate the object by 45Â° steps, or more smoothly by pressing SHIFT.
-   The blue square button allows you to reposition the object in its original position

:::tip Good to Know
clicking on the "activate transparency of space background colors" icon above the plan allows you to see the plan background in transparency to be able to place in Surfy the furniture present on the plan background.

You can easily and quickly duplicate an object or group of objects in Surfy.

### Duplicate an Object

-   "Activate plan editing mode" by clicking on the "pencil" icon above the plan
-   click on the object to duplicate and simultaneously press the "shift" (uppercase) key and the "C" key 
-   the duplicated object is at the mouse cursor. It retains the orientation of the initial object
-   click on the plan at the drop location of the duplicated object

:::tip Good to Know: "shift + C"
This functionality allows, by pointing the mouse directly at the position of the objects to create, to duplicate them with a simple keyboard shortcut ("shift" pressed, type "C") and drop them by clicking. The new object or group of objects is now selected, and ready for a new duplication by "shift+C".

### Duplicate a Group of Objects

-   "Activate plan editing mode" by clicking on the "pencil" icon above the plan
-   click on one of the objects to duplicate then on the others while holding the "shift" key pressed
-   a selection area encompassing the objects to duplicate is delimited, the objects to duplicate are selected.

To "copy" the objects, several options are possible:

-   by clicking on the "Duplicate shapes" icon above the plan
-   by simultaneously pressing the "shift" (uppercase) key and the "C" key

The duplicated objects are at the mouse cursor, ready to be dropped by clicking on the plan.
