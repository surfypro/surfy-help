-   click on "List object types" to display the list of used object types
-   place the list elements on top of/below each other by dragging the "=" sign of the object type from top to bottom
 -  click on the "butterfly" to the right of the object type names to define the number of seats for each of them (example: 1 seat for the Desk chair)

## Workstation Type Properties

A workstation type has the following properties:

-   <P code="workplaceType:name" />: name of the workstation type
-   <P code="workplaceType:color" />: color of the workstation type on plans
-   <P code="workplaceType:seats" />: number of seats of the workstation type (calculated automatically from the composition)
-   <P code="workplaceType:surface" />: surface of the workstation type (calculated automatically from the composition)

## Workstation Type Composition

A workstation type is composed of one or more object types placed relative to each other and grouped into a single entity.

The composition allows you to:

-   define the layout of objects in the workstation
-   define the number of seats for each object type
-   define the relative position of objects
-   define the rotation of objects

## Workstation Type Usage

Once created, a workstation type can be used to:

-   add workstations in spaces
-   duplicate workstations
-   modify workstation properties
-   delete workstations

The workstation type composition is automatically applied to all workstations of this type.
