# Surfy for Booking

You can book a workstation directly in Surfy or via the Teams application, for a day or half-day.<br />
To access a booking district (or building), you must be previously assigned to this district (or building).<br />
You can then book a workstation (or declare remote work) for half-day or full-day.<br />
