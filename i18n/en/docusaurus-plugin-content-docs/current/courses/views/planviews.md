# Plan Views

Plan views are pre-programmed displays and features to choose from based on the user's field of action. They are "shortcuts" to the requested features.

<Youtube code="1ZiLEj8NEVM"/>

## Choose a Plan View

You can choose a particular view of plans based on the task to accomplish or information to obtain, from a floor plan, by clicking on the vertical "change plan view" icon.
Changing view resets plan configuration by displaying information corresponding to the requested view.



The default view is recognizable by the small flag at the end of the view line. The default view is programmable for each user by modifying each person's role (Make the request to the platform administrator)

The selected view is valid for the user, across the entire platform. It will remain the same until changed and until "disconnection".
To disconnect from the platform, click at the bottom of the left menu on the user's first name or initials, then on "disconnect".

Upon reconnection, the default view -with the small flag- will be effective.

## "Space Typologies" View

This is Surfy's "standard" pre-programming, displayed by default.
It allows coloring spaces by typology, i.e., by their use destination: office, sanitary facilities, stairs,...
Typologies must be filled in at minimum in Surfy to obtain first colored plans.
This view displays space names and workstation names.

See the chapter [Create a Space Typology](/en/docs/tutorials/surfaces/room/roomtype#create-a-space-typology)

You can get cumulative data by Typology by clicking on the vertical "Color spaces on plan by space typologies" icon then on the butterfly "Open all details and indicators".

This view is adapted to the [Work Environment Management](https://www.surfy.pro/en-gb/ug/environnement-de-travail) which keeps the digitized building life up to date in Surfy, particularly by [arranging spaces](/en/docs/courses/digitalize/digicourse).

## "Rebilling" View

The "Rebilling" view colors spaces and workstations by cost center and displays the surface and cost center name of each space.

You can get cumulative data by cost center by clicking on the vertical "Color spaces and workstations by cost centers" icon then on the "Spaces" tab then on the butterfly "Open all details and indicators".
The "Workstations" tab allows counting workstations by cost center.

This view particularly corresponds to [Finance functions](https://www.surfy.pro/en-gb/ug/fonction-finances) or [Real Estate Directors](https://www.surfy.pro/en-gb/ug/direction-immobiliere) to manage [space rebilling by cost center](/en/docs/tutorials/cost-distribution-by-cost-center/create).


## "Directions" View

The "Directions" view colors spaces by Direction, and displays the surface and name of the attachment Direction for each space.
This view allows organizing or visualizing proper space distribution based on the attachment organization.

You can get cumulative data by Direction or by Service by clicking on the vertical "Color spaces on plan by Organizations" icon then on the butterfly "Open all details and indicators".

This view is adapted to [Executive Assistants](https://www.surfy.pro/en-gb/ff/affecter-les-collaborateurs) wanting to master their Service or Direction scope 
<!-- and [manage collaborator assignment](/en/docs/tutorials/category/workstation-assignments) on this scope. -->

## "Occupations" View

The "Occupations" view colors free workstations (in green), Flex workstations (in pink), shared workstations (in orange) and passage workstations (in blue) to allow quick visualization of assignment capacities on the floor.
Each space and workstation name is displayed.
No analysis layer is displayed, spaces remain without color.

You can select the [display of this information](/en/docs/courses/views/2Dviews#display-workstation-status-on-plan) by clicking on the vertical "Color workstations by their status" icon.

This view is intended to quickly access occupation information and allows returning just as quickly to the previous view.
The number of workstations of each qualification is permanently indicated in the building, floor or space card.

## "Flex" View

The "Flex" view colors workstations qualified as Flex (in pink) and allows quick location of these workstations.
No analysis layer is displayed, spaces remain without color.

You can access the [display of this information](/en/docs/courses/views/2Dviews#display-workstation-status-on-plan) by clicking on the vertical "Color workstations by their status" icon.
"Bookable" workstations can be colored (in light blue) to locate them on the plan.

This view is intended to quickly access information and allows returning just as quickly to the previous view.
The number of workstations of each qualification is permanently indicated in the building, floor or space card.

## "Security Compliance" View

The "Security Compliance" view displays the name and quality of Security team members (File Guide, File Closer, First Aider, Firefighter, ...) on their workstation and colors their assignment workstation in a defined color.
No analysis layer is displayed, spaces remain without color.

This view is intended to quickly access information and allows returning just as quickly to the previous view.
It is intended for [Security Managers](https://www.surfy.pro/en-gb/ug/sante-et-securite) wanting to [manage Security team members](/en/docs/tutorials/person/personSecurityProfile/list#visualize-security-profiles-on-plans) with complete peace of mind.


## "Districts" View

The "Districts" view colors spaces by assignment layers, groups spaces into districts following these layers and allows directly assigning people to these districts.

This is the ideal view for the [assignment manager](https://www.surfy.pro/en-gb/ff/affecter-les-collaborateurs), allowing them to [manage district assignment](/en/docs/tutorials/affectations/dimensionToPerson/create) but also [fixed workstation assignments](/en/docs/tutorials/affectations/workplaceaffectation/create).
You can indeed mix in the same space workstations declared as Flex (bookable or not) and fixed assignment workstations.


## "Partitions" View

In the "Partitions" view, no information or layer is displayed on the plan to visualize only the plan background.
This view allows [space planners](https://www.surfy.pro/en-gb/ff/amenager-et-optimiser-les-espaces) to verify compliance and [modify the plan background](/en/docs/tutorials/surfaces/background/edit) if necessary.
