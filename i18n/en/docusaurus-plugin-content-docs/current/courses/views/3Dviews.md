# Display 3D Plans

## Display a Floor's 3D Plan

By default, floor plans are displayed in 2D in Surfy.
Click to [Visualize a Floor Plan in 2D](/docs/courses/views/2Dviews.md#visualize-a-2d-plan)

To obtain a floor's 3D plan, from the floor's 2D plan,

-   click in the context menu (gray box below the search magnifying glass)
-   choose "Floor XXX's 3D plan"

The floor plan appears in 3D in zenith view

-   click on the vertical "gear" icon to "see plan options"
-   choose the partition representation type (with partitions, without partitions or half-height partitions)
-   the "Cuby" representation replaces each space with a cube taking up the space's layer color

The mouse wheel allows you to adjust the 3D plan size.
Left mouse click allows you to move the 3D plan in the screen window
Right mouse click allows you to tilt and orient the plan in space.

:::tip Good to know
Clicking on "Center plan in Zenith view" or "Center plan in Isometric view" allows you to display an image with calibrated dimensions in zenith or isometric view, and therefore interchangeable in third-party solution updates.
:::

3D plans are available for the floor or for the building.
They are dynamic and interactive.
You can display layers and workstation colors on the 3D view, as on the 2D view

Each modification on the 2D plan is immediately reported on the 3D plan.

## Display a Building's 3D Plan

Besides visualizing the complete building in 3D, this functionality allows access to cumulative information from different layers for the entire building.

To obtain a building's 3D plan, from the home page,

-   click on the icon at the end of the concerned building's color line
-   select "building XXX's interactive 3D plan"

The building's 3D plan is displayed, and the cumulative information from layers for the entire building is accessible through vertical icons, in the same way [as for a floor](/docs/courses/views/2Dviews.md#display-layers-on-the-plan).

-   click on the vertical "gear" icon to "see plan options"
-   select floors to display in the building
-   choose the partition representation type (with partitions, without partitions or half-height partitions)
-   the "Cuby" representation replaces each space with a cube taking up the space's layer color

You can adjust the "space between each floor" by operating the slider to the left of the 3D plan.

The mouse wheel allows you to adjust the 3D plan size.
Left mouse click allows you to tilt and orient the plan in space
Right mouse click allows you to move the 3D plan in the screen window.

You can tilt the 3D plan with a constant angle, by clicking on "Center plan in Isometric view"

## Display a Building in 3D on a Map

You can represent a building in 3D, positioned and oriented correctly on a "Maps" type map.

To display the geolocated building on a map,

-   fill in the building address by clicking on the Pencil "Edit building" icon on the building record
-   create and calibrate the ground floor structure (or the lowest floor excluding basements). See [Create a Floor's Structure](/docs/tutorials/surfaces/structure/create.md).

To visualize the geolocated building on a plan, click on the icon at the end of the concerned building's color line then on "See building in 3D on a plan".
The building appears in dynamic 3D in its environment.
By hovering over spaces and furniture, you can read space or furniture information and workstation assignments. You can display layers and obtain cumulative data by layers, ...
