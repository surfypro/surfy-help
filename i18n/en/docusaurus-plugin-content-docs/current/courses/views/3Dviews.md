# Display Plans in 3D

## Display a Floor Plan in 3D

By default, floor plans are displayed in 2D in Surfy.
Click to [View a floor plan in 2D](/en/docs/courses/views/2Dviews.md#view-a-plan-in-2d)

To get the 3D plan of a floor, from the 2D plan of the floor,

-   click in the context menu (gray box below the search magnifying glass)
-   choose "Floor XXX plan in 3D"

The floor plan appears in 3D in zenith view

-   click on the vertical "gear" icon to "view plan options"
-   choose the type of partition representation (with partitions, without partition or half-height partitions)
-   the "Cuby" representation replaces each space with a cube taking the color of the space layer

The mouse wheel allows you to adjust the size of the 3D plan.
Mouse click1 allows you to move the 3D plan in the screen window
Mouse click2 allows you to tilt and orient the plan in space.

:::tip Good to Know
Clicking on "Center the plan in Zenith view" or "Center the plan in Isometric view" allows you to display an image with calibrated dimensions in zenith or Isometric view, and therefore interchangeable in third-party solution updates.
:::

3D plans are available for the floor or for the building.
They are dynamic and interactive.
You can display layers and workstation colors on the 3D view, as on the 2D view

Each modification on the 2D plan is immediately reported on the 3D plan.

## Display a Building's 3D Plan

In addition to the complete building visualization in 3D, this functionality allows access to the accumulation of information from different layers for the entire building.

To get the 3D plan of a building, from the home page,

-   click on the icon at the end of the color line of the concerned building
-   select "the interactive 3D plan of building XXX"

The building's 3D plan is displayed, and the accumulation of layer information for the entire building is accessible by vertical icons, in the same way [as for a floor](/en/docs/courses/views/2Dviews.md#display-layers-on-plan).

-   click on the vertical "gear" icon to "view plan options"
-   select the floors to display in the building
-   choose the type of partition representation (with partitions, without partition or half-height partitions)
-   the "Cuby" representation replaces each space with a cube taking the color of the space layer

You can adjust the "space between each floor" by operating the slider to the left of the 3D plan.

The mouse wheel allows you to adjust the size of the 3D plan.
Mouse click1 allows you to tilt and orient the plan in space
Mouse click2 allows you to move the 3D plan in the screen window.

You can tilt the 3D plan with a constant angle, by clicking on "Center the plan in Isometric view"

## Display a Building in 3D on a Map

You can represent a building in 3D, positioned and oriented correctly on a "Maps" type map.

To display the geolocated building on a map,

-   fill in the building address by clicking on the Pencil icon "Modify building" on the building card
-   create and calibrate the ground floor structure (or the lowest floor excluding basements). See [Create a floor structure](/en/docs/tutorials/surfaces/structure/create.md).


To visualize the geolocated building on a plan, click on the icon at the end of the color line of the concerned building then on "View the building in 3D on a plan".
The building appears in dynamic 3D in its environment.
By hovering over spaces and furniture, you can read space or furniture information and workstation assignments. You can display layers and get cumulative data by layers, ...
