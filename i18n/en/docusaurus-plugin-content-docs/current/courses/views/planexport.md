# Save Plans as Images

You can export different types of plans as PNG files from Surfy:
-   2D floor plans
-   2D building floor plans, partial or complete
-   3D floor plans
-   3D building plans, partial or complete

All plans are exported in PNG format.

## Export 2D Plans as Images

### Export a 2D Floor Plan

To export a floor plan as an Image,

-   go to the relevant floor
-   display on the plan the layer and information necessary for image output: furniture, text display, font size, icon size, ...

For more information on plan display configuration, see the chapter [Display Plans in 2D](/en/docs/courses/views/2Dviews.md).

-   once the plan is configured, click on the "cloud" icon above the plan to "save as Image" the floor plan.

-   choose the download option by clicking on:

    -   Entire plan with legend: to get the entire floor plan as it is in Surfy, with layer legends and cumulative information by layer
    -   Entire plan without legend: to get the entire floor plan as it is in Surfy, without legends
    -   Screenshot without legend: to get the part of the plan displayed on screen, without legends

The PNG file is available in downloads.

### Configure the 2D Plan Legend to Export

When exporting a floor plan as an image with legend, the "default legend" is composed of:

-   company logo
-   building name and address (if provided)
-   floor name
-   floor information, identical to the floor card information to the left of the plan
-   displayed layer legend, with cumulative information by layer.

You can customize the legend displayed on image output by creating legends adapted to the information to display.

To do this, from the left menu,

-   click on "Administration" then "Legend" to "Create a legend"
-   give a name to the legend to create
-   in "Configuration", "Property Selection", check the properties and information to display for "buildings" and "floors"
-   in "Space typologies", check the information to display (number of spaces, total capacity) for each space typology present on the platform
-   in "space typology groups", check the information to display (number of spaces, total capacity) for each space typology group present on the platform.
-   "validate creation" of the legend

When exporting a floor plan as an image with legend, "select legend" to the right of the screen allows you to find the different saved legends to display the selected legend.

The legend preview is viewable by clicking on the "Preview legend" icon at the bottom of the "save as image" card to the right of the screen.

:::tip GOOD TO KNOW
A space typology group allows grouping several space typologies to facilitate their management and display.
You can create for example a space typology group "Meeting spaces" grouping the space typologies "Meeting room", "Bubble" and "Meeting box" to display or cumulate information from all typologies included in the group.

To configure a space typology group, see the chapter on [Space Typology Groups](/en/docs/tutorials/surfaces/room/roomtype/#space-typology-groups)

### Export 2D Plans of Multiple Floors

You can export plans of multiple floors simultaneously,
-   click on "Export images of entire building"
-   select floors to export
-   click on "download ZIP"

The compressed file is available in downloads.

:::tip Good to know
All floor plans take the configuration of the plan from which the export is made: no need to load the right layer, the right legend or choose the right font size for each floor, once is enough!

## Export 3D Plans as Images

3D plans are available for the floor or for the building.
They are dynamic and interactive.

Each modification on the 2D plan is immediately reported on the 3D plan.

### Export a Building's 3D Plan

To get a building's 3D plan, from the home page,

-   click on the icon at the end of the color line of the relevant building
-   select "the interactive 3D plan of building XXX"
-   click on the vertical "gear" icon to "view plan options"
-   select floors to display in the building
-   choose the type of partition representation (with partitions, without partition or half-height partitions)
-   the "Cuby" representation replaces each space with a cube taking the color of the space layer

You can adjust the "space between each floor" by operating the slider to the left of the 3D plan.

The mouse wheel allows you to adjust the size of the 3D plan.
Mouse click1 allows you to tilt and orient the plan in space
Mouse click2 allows you to move the 3D plan in the screen window.

You can tilt the 3D plan with a constant angle, by clicking on "Center the plan in Isometric view"

Once the 3D plan is correctly configured,

-   click on the vertical "gear" icon to "view plan options" (if not already done)
-   click on "Download image"

The export gives the 3D building image as it is on screen.
The building's 3D plan is available in downloads.


### Export a Floor's 3D Plan

To get a floor's 3D plan, from the floor plan,

-   click in the context menu (gray box below the search magnifying glass)
-   choose "Floor XXX plan in 3D"

The floor plan appears in 3D in zenith view

-   click on the vertical "gear" icon to "view plan options"
-   choose the type of partition representation (with partitions, without partition or half-height partitions)
-   the "Cuby" representation replaces each space with a cube taking the color of the space layer

The mouse wheel allows you to adjust the size of the 3D plan.
Mouse click1 allows you to move the 3D plan in the screen window
Mouse click2 allows you to tilt and orient the plan in space.

:::tip Good to know
Clicking on "Center the plan in Zenith view" or "Center the plan in Isometric view" allows you to display an image with calibrated dimensions in zenith or Isometric view, and therefore interchangeable in third-party solution updates.

Clicking on "Download image" generates the PNG file in downloads.
The 3D floor image is as it is on screen.
