# Billing and Estimation

## Bill Spaces by Cost Center

See the tutorial chapter [Bill Spaces by Cost Center](/en/docs/tutorials/cost-distribution-by-cost-center/create.md)

    -   Define [cost centers](/en/docs/tutorials/costcenter/create.md)
    -   [Qualify spaces](/en/docs/tutorials/surfaces/room/edit#qualify-a-space-or-modify-space-information) and [workstations](/en/docs/tutorials/objects/workplace/edit.md#modify-workstation-information) by cost center
    -   Qualify spaces by [Cost Distribution Type](/en/docs/tutorials/costcenter/create.md#cost-distribution-type): space or workstations
    -   Get [distribution keys and surface totals](/en/docs/tutorials/cost-distribution-by-cost-center/create.md#distribution-keys-and-surfaces-qualified-by-cost-center) to bill
    -   [Allocate common areas](/en/docs/tutorials/cost-distribution-by-cost-center/create.md#allocate-common-areas)
    -   Do not bill spaces: Spaces and workstations without [cost distribution type](/en/docs/tutorials/costcenter/create.md#cost-distribution-type) do not appear anywhere and their surface is not counted anywhere.
      

## Estimate a Cleaning Service

    -   [Define cleaning frequencies](/en/docs/tutorials/dimensionType/create.md#create-and-associate-an-analysis-layer-to-a-layer-type)
    -   Define [cleaning rates](/entities/admin/types/room-types/room-type#cadence) of space typologies or Define the <P code="roomType:cadence"/>
    -   [Qualify spaces by cleaning frequency](/en/docs/tutorials/surfaces/room/edit#qualify-a-space-or-modify-space-information)
    -   [Get the monthly hours needed for the cleaning service](/en/docs/tutorials/BuildingData/Buildingdashboard/Buildingreporting#building-cleaning-service-report)
