To create a new building from the Surfy homepage, you click on the context menu, then “Create Building”, there you give the name of the building of course then a color for its surroundings.

From the moment you provide these two pieces of information, you have the possibility of validating  the creation of the building, but you can also complete with additional information  such as the theoretical surface area, the start and end date of the lease in the event that you are a tenant,  a date of purchase of the building in the case where you are the owner, you have a line to indicate links to associated documents, you have the possibility of putting  a photo of the building which will be notably visible on the page of home of reader profiles,  and then you can complete with a number of parking spaces, a year of construction, annual charges, etc. etc.
 
You have the possibility of adding the address of the building, very useful for a multi site: you find your buildings on a map. The type of building will allow you to say whether you are an owner or a tenant, the user who owns the building in the case of a scenario is the one who will create the scenario, and then the reference building is the building behind which the possible scenario is hidden, i.e. its original building from which it was created.
 
But the reference building can also be any building behind which the building in question is hidden. Once your information is filled in, you validate the creation and when you return to your home page you have your building created. You can then modify it to create floors and thus complete your building.
