# Access via Secure Enterprise Account

## ENTERPRISE Access

Upon [request](https://www.surfy.pro/contact), an "ENTERPRISE" access can be set up allowing users to connect directly to the company platform using their professional email address via a defined access (Okta, ...).
User roles (generally the Reader role) are configured as well as visible content (Buildings X and Z, floor Y,...) for all collaborators accessing the platform. These roles can then be modified individually for specific cases.

If the company has configured a specific "ENTERPRISE" access with Surfy, you can follow the procedure below.<br />
If this is not the case but your company is a Surfy user, use the access established by your company ([OFFICE365](/en/docs/access/office365), [GOOGLE](/en/docs/access/google) or [SURFY Account](/en/docs/access/surfy))<br />
