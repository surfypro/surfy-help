# Access to Surfy  

## who can access the platform ?

Accessing an organization's Surfy platform requires creating a secure account validated by the organization.  
The features available to each user are determined by the organization based on assigned roles, and visible content is customized according to user permissions.  

## SaaS Mode  

Software as a Service (SaaS)is a licensing and distribution model where software applications are provided over the Internet as a service. Users access the applications via a subscription.  

Surfy operates in SaaS mode, with the application and data hosted in France on Microsoft Azure servers.

## Creating a User  

### Account Creation Request  

To access Surfy, the organization must have an active subscription to the solution.  

Future users can create a [Surfy](/docs/access/surfy) account, a [Microsoft Office 365](/docs/access/office365) account, or a [Google](/docs/access/google) account to request connection to the organization’s platform.  
If the organization uses secure access via a [business](/docs/access/company) account, users can directly access the platform by selecting that option.  

### Organization Users  

Once the connection request is approved by the organization, roles and content access rights are assigned to the user.  
The user can then freely access the organization’s Surfy platform based on these permissions.
